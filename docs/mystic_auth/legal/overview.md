# Legal Documents and Signup Consent

---

Ships a Privacy Policy and Terms of Service as real in-app pages, written against this template's actual data flows rather than generic boilerplate, plus the consent notice that links to them from Signup. Both documents are content you're expected to review and edit before shipping to real users; see "Operator responsibility" below.

## Signup consent is a notice, not a gate

Signup does **not** block submission behind an unchecked consent checkbox. `SignupForm.tsx` renders a static sentence under the submit button ("By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy," via `agreeToTermsPrefix`/`termsOfService`/`and`/`privacyPolicy` keys in the `auth` namespace), with `AuthInlineLink`s to `/terms` and `/privacy`. Creating an account is treated as acceptance by using the service, the same "notice, not a checkbox" pattern many production signup flows use, rather than an interactive consent gate with its own validation state.

`signup_form_legal_consent.test.tsx` is a regression guard specifically for this: it renders `SignupForm` and asserts both links exist with the right `href`, guarding against the line (or either link) silently disappearing, not against a missing checkbox, since there isn't one.

The same links (`AuthInlineLink to="/terms"` / `to="/privacy"`) also appear on `LoginPage.tsx`, the `LandingPage.tsx` footer, and `AccountSettingsPage.tsx`, so a visitor or an already-signed-in user can reach either document without going through Signup at all.

---

## Document structure and content

Both `PrivacyPolicyPage` and `TermsOfServicePage` follow the same shape: a `title`, an `intro` (array of paragraphs), and `sections` (array of `{ heading, paragraphs }`), all resolved from `legal.json` via `t(..., { returnObjects: true })` and typed as `LegalSection[]`. `LegalDocumentLayout` renders whatever it's given, plus a shared "Last updated" date (`lastUpdatedDate` in `legal.json`) and a Back button.

`legal.json`'s privacy policy is organized as: account data collected, session/device data (IP, user agent, geolocation, cookies), security/authorization logs, who data is shared with (Google, the SMTP relay, the error-monitoring service), retention (including that security/audit logs are **not** deleted when an account is purged), user rights, children's privacy, and how policy changes are communicated. Its content is written to describe _this template's own actual behavior_ (e.g. "we use two cookies: `access_token` and `refresh_token`, both `httpOnly`, `Secure`, and `SameSite=Strict`"; "security and authorization log entries referencing your account are not deleted when your account is purged"), not generic placeholder legal text.

Two interpolated placeholders are deliberately left for the operator to fill in, not this template:

- `operatorContactPlaceholder`: a real support contact email, interpolated into the privacy policy's "Your rights" section and the terms' "Contact" section.
- `operatorEntityPlaceholder`: a legal entity name and jurisdiction, interpolated into the terms' "Governing law" section.

Both default to bracketed placeholder text (e.g. `[operator: replace with your support contact email]`) so an unedited deployment reads obviously unfinished rather than silently wrong.

---

## Operator responsibility

`legal.json` itself carries an `operatorReviewNote` key stating this directly: the content describes the software's actual behavior as built, not generic boilerplate, but if you're the operator deploying this template, review it against your own use case before publishing it as a live policy. Concretely, before shipping to real users:

1. Replace `operatorContactPlaceholder` and `operatorEntityPlaceholder` (and any other bracketed placeholder) in every language's `legal.json`.
2. Re-read both documents against what your actual deployment does: if you've disabled a feature (e.g. session geolocation, error monitoring) or added your own data collection, the shipped text will be wrong until you edit it to match.
3. Update `lastUpdatedDate` when you materially change either document, the same convention the shipped copy already documents in its own "Changes to this policy"/"Changes to these terms" sections.
4. Since `docs/mystic_auth/` is upstream template documentation (see the top-level [docs README](../README.md)), `legal.json` itself is the piece you actually edit for your own deployment, the same "app-owner-level default, edit directly" tier `frontend/src/app/theme.ts` uses; it is not something upstream sync should overwrite your own edits to. See [Staying in Sync with Upstream Template Updates](../template-usage/syncing-upstream.md) if you've diverged from the shipped copy.

## Adding a language

`legal.json` is one of the thirteen translation namespaces (see [Translations Overview](../translations/overview.md)); adding a new language means adding a `legal.json` for it, following the same `title`/`intro`/`sections` shape as the English version, alongside every other namespace file the [language tutorial](../translations/adding-a-language.md) walks through.

---

## Where to go next

- [Translations Overview](../translations/overview.md): how the `legal` namespace fits into the rest of the translation system.
- [Signup and Email Verification](../authentication/signup-and-verification.md): the rest of the signup flow this consent notice is part of.
