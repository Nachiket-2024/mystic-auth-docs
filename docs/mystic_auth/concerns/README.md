Tracked deliberately rather than left as silent gaps. Each entry reflects an active, unresolved limitation in the current implementation: nothing speculative, and nothing already fixed (resolved items live in the relevant feature documentation instead).

## Security

### Database backups are scheduled, integrity-checked, and optionally shipped off-host, but there's still no point-in-time recovery or failure alerting

**Description**: `docker-compose.prod.yml` and every `docker-compose.local-prod-*.yml` variant run a `db_backup` service by default: a loop that calls `pg_dump --format=custom` on an interval (`BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`), immediately verifies the dump with `pg_restore --list`, and writes it to `./backups` on the same host, deleting dumps older than `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`. `scripts/mystic_auth/db/db_backup.sh` (manual/on-demand backups) does the same. An optional `BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND` hook (blank by default) then runs after each verified dump with `DUMP_FILE` exported to it, so an operator can plug in `aws s3 cp`/`rclone copy`/`rsync`/etc. to ship the dump off-host without this template hardcoding a provider. This closes the original gaps ("no scheduler exists at all", "plain-text dumps with no verification", "single point of failure with no off-host path") but the mechanism still stops short of full production Postgres backup practice.

**Impact**: Two remaining gaps against a real production setup:

- **No point-in-time recovery**: this is periodic full dumps only, so worst-case data loss is up to `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` of writes, not "up to the last transaction" the way WAL-based continuous archiving gives you.
- **No active alerting**: a failed dump, failed `pg_restore --list` check, or failed `BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND` is visible (`set -e` restarts the container) but only through container logs/`docker compose ps` someone has to be watching - there's no active paging.
- **`BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND` is opt-in and unset by default**: a deployment that doesn't configure it still has dumps living only on the same host/disk as the database they're backing up.

**Why it's not fully fixed yet**: real PITR means integrating a dedicated tool (`pgBackRest`, `WAL-G`) for WAL archiving, which is more surface area than this loop was designed for - deliberately deferred rather than rushed. The off-host upload gap has a hook, but the template still assumes no specific cloud provider, so an operator has to supply the actual upload command (and, for S3-family targets, install `aws-cli`/`rclone` themselves - the `postgres:15` base image doesn't include one).

**Possible fix**: In order of effort - (1) ~~add an optional operator-supplied shell hook (`BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND`) that runs after a successful dump~~ done; (2) wire a failure path into the Bugsink error-monitoring already in this stack, so a failed dump, failed verification, or failed upload pages someone instead of sitting in logs; (3) for real uptime/RPO requirements, replace the whole mechanism with `pgBackRest`/`WAL-G` or a managed Postgres provider's own backup feature instead of extending this loop further.

**Priority**: Low/Medium for a real production deployment - lower than before now that off-host shipping just needs one env var set, rather than a missing mechanism. Still Medium if PITR-level RPO actually matters for the data involved (this app stores password hashes, sessions, audit logs). Low/N/A for local development or a throwaway deployment.

### Secrets rotation is only half-automated

**Description**: `scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/rotate-secrets/` rotates `SECRET_KEY` and `BUGSINK_SECRET_KEY` cleanly, since both are pure env-file values with no live-database counterpart to update. `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `APP_DB_PASSWORD`, and `BUGSINK_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD` are documented in that script's own header as needing a manual live-database step (`ALTER USER ... PASSWORD`, then restarting the dependent services) instead, since rotating those requires touching a running Postgres role, not just a file.

**Impact**: An operator rotating credentials has to know, separately from the tool, which three fields need that extra manual step. Skipping it (assuming the rotate script alone was enough) leaves the env file and the live database role out of sync, and the affected service fails to authenticate on its next restart.

**Why it exists**: The rotate script only ever touches env files, deliberately, so it never needs live database credentials or a running stack to work. Extending it to also run the `ALTER USER` step means giving it DB connectivity and admin rights it doesn't otherwise need, a real increase in what the script can do and what could go wrong if run against the wrong target.

**Possible fix**: A guided companion script (or an extra flag on the existing one) that, for these three fields only, connects to the live database with the current credentials, runs the `ALTER USER` statement, writes the new value to the env file, and restarts the dependent service, all as one confirmed step instead of a manual runbook.

**Priority**: Low. The manual step is documented at the point of use, and the failure mode (a service failing to authenticate) is loud and immediate, not silent.

## Dependencies

---

### Dependency updates are manual, not automated

**Description**: No Dependabot or Renovate config exists. `pip-audit`/`npm audit` in CI catch known CVEs in whatever versions are currently pinned, but nothing proactively opens a PR when a newer version ships.

**Why it exists**: This repo ran Dependabot earlier and turned it off. Its PRs updated packages independently of each other (for example bumping TypeScript without ESLint's TypeScript-parsing plugins in the same PR), which produced breakage from version skew between packages that need to move together, not from the updates themselves. Manual, batched updates (bumping a related group together, then running the full test suite once) avoid that failure mode, at the cost of updates happening less often.

**Impact**: A dependency with a known fix available won't get flagged until the next manual review, beyond whatever `pip-audit`/`npm audit` already catches for known CVEs specifically.

**Possible fix**: Revisit a bot-based approach only if grouped-update support (bumping a set of interdependent packages together in one PR, e.g. Dependabot's `groups` config) closes the version-skew problem that caused it to be turned off the first time; otherwise, keep this manual and batched.

**Priority**: Low. Known-CVE coverage already exists via `pip-audit`/`npm audit`; this gap is specifically about staying current on non-CVE releases.

---

## CI/CD

---

### No deploy automation

**Description**: `docker-build` in CI verifies that both Dockerfiles build but does not push to a registry or deploy anywhere.

**Why it exists**: This is a template repository with no assumed production target. See [Deployment Guide](../deployment/production-host.md). Adding a deploy stage would need to assume a specific host.

**Priority**: N/A, an intentional scope boundary, not a gap.

---

### Performance tests are non-blocking in CI

**Description**: The backend `performance` suite (`tests/backend/mystic_auth/performance`) runs in CI with `continue-on-error: true`, so a failure there is visible but never fails the build.

**Impact**: A genuine performance regression could land on `main` without CI stopping it. Only a human reviewing that job's result would catch it.

**Why it exists**: These tests assert generous regression-alarm thresholds against a real Postgres/Redis, so timing is inherently noisier than a correctness test on shared/loaded runners: a slow CI runner or concurrent load can trip a timing assertion with no actual code regression behind it (observed directly during this repo's own manual test runs).

**Possible fix**: Tighten the thresholds and/or the runner environment until false positives are rare enough to make the job blocking, or move to a dedicated, less noisy performance-testing environment instead of sharing CI's general-purpose runners.

**Priority**: Low. Correctness is still enforced elsewhere through blocking unit, integration, and security suites. This only affects how fast a real performance regression would be noticed.
