## 3. Recommended reading order

---

1. For local development, read [Dev Deployment](dev.md).
2. For a production-shaped local run through a tunnel, read [Local-Prod Deployment](local-prod/README.md), then one tunnel tutorial from that folder.
3. For a public server deployment, read [Prod Deployment](prod.md).
4. Before any production-shaped run, read [Environment and Runtime Configuration](environment.md).
5. Before relying on a deployment, read [Migrations and Backups](migrations-and-backups.md) and [Production Host Requirements](production-host.md).
