# Deployment Guide

---

Reference material shared across all three deployment modes. For
step-by-step instructions on running a given mode, see:

- [Dev Deployment](dev.md): local development, hot reload, no TLS
- [Local-Prod Deployment](local-prod.md): self-hosted production image shape,
  exposed via a free Cloudflare Tunnel, no public server needed
- [Prod Deployment](prod.md): your own server with Caddy-managed TLS

New to the repo? Start with [Dev Deployment](dev.md). It's the mode you'll
use day to day, and needs no domain, tunnel, or server.

## Choosing the right env template

Each mode has its own dedicated env file, so all three can have real values
filled in at once without one overwriting another. Pick the template for the
mode you are running and copy it to its matching real file (not to a shared
`.env` used by every mode).

| Mode       | Copy this file            | To this file      | Use with                        | Best for                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Dev        | `.env.example`            | `.env`            | `docker-compose.yml`            | Local development with hot reload      |
| Local-prod | `.env.local-prod.example` | `.env.local-prod` | `docker-compose.local-prod.yml` | Your machine through Cloudflare Tunnel |
| Prod       | `.env.prod.example`       | `.env.prod`       | `docker-compose.prod.yml`       | Your own server with Caddy TLS         |

```bash
# Dev
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
# or: ./scripts/docker/dev-up.sh

# Local-prod
cp .env.local-prod.example .env.local-prod
docker compose -f docker-compose.local-prod.yml --env-file .env.local-prod up -d --build
# or: ./scripts/docker/local-prod-up.sh

# Prod
cp .env.prod.example .env.prod
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build
# or: ./scripts/docker/prod-up.sh
```

---

The `--env-file` flag (or the equivalent `scripts/docker/*-up.{sh,ps1,cmd}`
helper) matters for local-prod and prod: Compose only auto-loads a file
literally named `.env` for `${VAR}`-style substitution (e.g. frontend build
args) in the compose YAML itself. Each service's `env_file:` entry already
points at the right dedicated file, but without `--env-file` those build-arg
substitutions would silently fall back to whatever (if anything) is in `.env`
instead of `.env.local-prod`/`.env.prod`.

---

Important rules:

- `.env`, `.env.local-prod`, and `.env.prod` are all user-managed local
  configuration. Keep them out of git.
- The example files are checked in documentation and defaults. Update them
  when the required settings change.
- `frontend/.env.example` is only for running the frontend directly with
  `npm run dev --prefix frontend`. Docker reads `VITE_*` values from the
  mode's dedicated env file above.
- Production-style frontend values are baked into the image at build time:
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_APP_NAME`, `VITE_BRAND_COLOR`, `VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL`,
  `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, and `VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`. `VITE_APP_NAME`/
  `VITE_BRAND_COLOR`/`VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL` are aliased from the backend
  `APP_NAME`/`BRAND_COLOR`/`SUPPORT_EMAIL` vars in the compose files rather
  than needing their own separate entries. After changing any of these,
  rebuild the frontend image with `--build`.
- Runtime backend values, such as `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`,
  `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, SMTP settings, and rate-limit settings, are read when
  containers start. After changing them, recreate or restart the affected
  containers.

---

## Single-origin frontend/backend routing

The frontend container's nginx (`docker/nginx.frontend.conf`) also proxies API
route prefixes to the backend. It forwards `/auth`, `/audit`, `/users`,
`/authorization`, `/health`, and `/rate-limits` to the `backend` service. In each
production-style Compose file, the frontend container is pinned to a fixed
address on that file's own subnet - `172.28.0.10` in
`docker-compose.local-prod.yml`, `172.29.0.10` in `docker-compose.prod.yml` -
so the backend can list that address in `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` and trust its
`X-Forwarded-For` header. The two files deliberately use different subnets
(`172.28.0.0/24` vs. `172.29.0.0/24`) so both can run on the same Docker host
at once without a network pool collision - see each file's own `ipam`
comment.

This single-origin setup works when `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is empty and
`TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` matches that file's own pinned addresses -
`172.28.0.10,172.28.0.11` for local-prod, `172.29.0.10,172.29.0.11` for prod.
Both are set by default in `.env.local-prod.example` and `.env.prod.example`
respectively. If your TLS terminator sits in front of this nginx, forward to
port 80 and let nginx proxy the API paths internally.
`proxy_add_x_forwarded_for` appends rather than overwrites, so the client IP
chain is preserved.

If you deploy the frontend elsewhere, point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` at the backend's
real public origin. Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` to the proxy that actually sits in
front of the backend for that topology.

---

### Route collisions between the SPA and the proxied API prefixes

Because the SPA's client-side routes (`frontend/src/app/App.tsx`) and the
backend's route prefixes share one origin, a frontend route whose path starts
with one of the proxied prefixes above (`auth`, `audit`, `users`,
`authorization`, `health`, `rate-limits`) collides with it. `/users` and
`/rate-limits` are exactly this: real SPA pages, but also exact backend
prefixes. Client-side navigation (clicking a sidebar link) never hits nginx
at all, so it's unaffected, but a **hard refresh or direct/bookmarked
navigation** to one of those URLs is a real browser request nginx has to
route, and the regex proxy rule matched it before the SPA ever got a chance:
the browser rendered the backend's raw JSON response (e.g. the full admin
user list from `GET /users`) instead of the app.

Fixed in `docker/nginx.frontend.conf` with exact-match (`location =`)
locations for `/users` and `/rate-limits` that force those two bare paths to
`index.html`, placed before the regex proxy block:

```nginx
location = /users {
    try_files /index.html /index.html;
}
location = /rate-limits {
    try_files /index.html /index.html;
}
```

This is safe specifically because the frontend never calls those bare paths
itself: every real API call uses a trailing slash or sub-path
(`/users/`, `/users/{email}`, `/rate-limits/`, `/rate-limits/{key}`,
never a bare `/users` or `/rate-limits` GET). `location =` exact matches
always win over a regex `location ~` match in nginx regardless of which one
is declared first, so this reliably wins the collision without touching the
proxy rule other routes depend on.

**If you add a new top-level SPA route** whose path starts with `auth`,
`audit`, `users`, `authorization`, `health`, or `rate-limits` (e.g. a future
`/health-status` page), check whether it collides the same way, and add a
matching `location =` exact-match block for it before the regex proxy block.
This is an allowlist of specific collisions, not a general rule: a new
colliding route needs its own carve-out, the same as `/users` and
`/rate-limits` got here.

## Required production environment variables

`.env.local-prod.example` and `.env.prod.example` already set the values
below correctly. This section explains the values you must review before
real production use:

- `ENVIRONMENT=production` disables `/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` on
  the backend. See `backend/app/main.py`.
- Generate or rotate `SECRET_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`,
  `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` for production. Do not reuse
  local `.env` or CI values.
- Configure at least one user verification path before expecting normal users
  to reach the dashboard. Password signup requires SMTP email delivery because
  password accounts cannot log in until verified. Google login requires
  `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, and
  creates a verified account using Google's verified-email signal.
- The CLI-created system superuser is the exception. It is marked verified by
  the script and can sign in with its password without Google or SMTP.
- Point `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` and `BACKEND_BASE_URL` at the real production
  hostnames. CORS in `backend/app/main.py` allows `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` plus
  comma-separated `FRONTEND_ADDITIONAL_BASE_URLS`. Leave the additional list
  unset for a single-origin deployment.
- `JWT_ISSUER` and `JWT_AUDIENCE` are required settings minted into every
  access/refresh/verify JWT's `iss`/`aud` claims and checked back on
  `verify_token()`. Typically both `BACKEND_BASE_URL`, since this API is both
  the token issuer and the sole resource server that validates its own
  tokens. Update them alongside `BACKEND_BASE_URL` when the domain changes.
- `GEOIP_DB_PATH` is optional: a path to a local MaxMind GeoLite2-City
  `.mmdb` file, used to resolve login IPs to city/country for the "Manage
  Sessions" dashboard's Location column. Leave it empty to disable
  geolocation (Location shows "Unknown"); nothing else depends on it. The
  `.mmdb` file itself can't ship in this repo (MaxMind's license forbids
  redistribution). Download it yourself with a free MaxMind account and
  license key, then mount or bake it into the image at that path. Under
  Docker, `docker-compose.local-prod.yml`/`docker-compose.prod.yml` ship an
  optional `geoipupdate` service that fetches and refreshes it for you, but
  it's gated behind the `geoip` Compose profile: setting `GEOIP_DB_PATH`
  and the `GEOIPUPDATE_*` values in `.env.local-prod`/`.env.prod` alone does
  nothing until you also pass `--profile geoip` on `docker compose up`. See
  [Session Geolocation](../geolocation/overview.md)
  for the full walkthrough, Docker and non-Docker.
- `USER_EXPORT_MAX_ROWS` caps how many rows `GET /users/export` will return
  in one filtered request (that endpoint has no offset/limit of its own).
  A request matching more rows than this is rejected rather than loaded
  entirely into memory. The default of `50000` is a reasonable starting
  point; raise it only if you expect a larger user base and have sized the
  backend accordingly.
- Set `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` to your reverse proxy's address when a proxy sits in
  front of the backend. This lets rate limiting, lockout, and audit logging read
  the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For`. Leave it unset for direct backend
  traffic. See [Security Hardening: Abuse Prevention](../security/hardening-abuse-prevention.md#rate-limiting) and
  [Authorization Context Builder](../authorization/architecture.md#authorization-context-builder).
- `DEFAULT_APP_POLICIES` auto-assigns your own app's policies to every user
  once verified, alongside `self_service`. Leave it unset if your app has no
  default permissions beyond `self_service`. See [Writing and Testing
  Policies](../authorization/writing-testing-policies.md#giving-every-user-a-second-default-policy).
- `SENTRY_DSN` and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` are optional. Leave them unset to disable
  error monitoring. If you enable self-hosted Bugsink in production, set real
  values for `BUGSINK_SECRET_KEY`, `BUGSINK_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`,
  `BUGSINK_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, and `BUGSINK_BASE_URL`.
- `SENTRY_DSN` and `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` differ in self-hosted Bugsink setups.
  `SENTRY_DSN` is backend-only and can use `bugsink:8000`. `bugsink-seed`
  auto-wires it through the shared volume. `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is baked into the
  browser bundle at build time and must use the public route to Bugsink. See
  [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md).
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_APP_NAME`, `VITE_BRAND_COLOR`, `VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL`,
  `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, and `VITE_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` are consumed at **image
  build time**, not container runtime. `docker-compose.local-prod.yml` and
  `docker-compose.prod.yml` pass them to `docker/frontend.Dockerfile` as
  build args - `VITE_APP_NAME`/`VITE_BRAND_COLOR`/`VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL` are
  aliased there from `APP_NAME`/`BRAND_COLOR`/`SUPPORT_EMAIL`, so set those
  three instead of the `VITE_` ones.
  Set them in `.env.local-prod`/`.env.prod` before
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.local-prod.yml --env-file .env.local-prod up -d --build` or
  `docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.prod up -d --build`. Values only in
  `frontend/.env` are invisible to Compose interpolation.

---

## Database migrations

The `alembic` service runs `alembic upgrade head` once and exits. `backend`
and `procrastinate_worker` both wait on it using Compose's `service_completed_successfully`
condition, so nothing serves traffic against an unmigrated schema.

Before applying a migration in production, review the generated script under
`backend/alembic/versions/`, especially anything that drops or alters a column
or table. Alembic autogenerate is a starting point, not a safety guarantee.

Migrations always run as the `DATABASE_URL` role (superuser), since DDL and
role management require it. The request-serving app and the Procrastinate
worker's task bodies instead prefer `APP_DATABASE_URL`, a separate
least-privilege Postgres role with only CRUD rights on application tables, if
it's set (`.env.prod.example`/`.env.local-prod.example` ship it enabled by
default). See [Security Decisions: Least-privilege app DB role](../security/decisions-infra.md#least-privilege-app-db-role-instead-of-running-as-postgres-superuser)
for the full reasoning and what it does and does not protect against.

---

## Backups

`scripts/db/db_backup.sh` and `scripts/db/db_restore.sh` wrap the `pg_dump` and `psql`
commands below. They read `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_DB` from the env file
matching whichever compose file you pass (`.env`, `.env.local-prod`, or
`.env.prod`), run through Docker Compose, and make no cloud or provider
assumptions.

```bash
# Dump the running postgres service to backups/<db>-<timestamp>.sql
scripts/db/db_backup.sh
# Against the production compose file instead of the dev one:
scripts/db/db_backup.sh docker-compose.local-prod.yml

# Restore a dump. Use -y to skip confirmation.
scripts/db/db_restore.sh backups/mystic_auth-20260717-120000.sql
```

These scripts are the "how" for an on-demand dump or a restore. For "on a
schedule, unattended", both `docker-compose.prod.yml` and
`docker-compose.local-prod.yml` also run a `db_backup` service by default: a
small container that dumps Postgres to `./backups` on its own loop, using
`BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`/`BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` from the matching env file
(both default to a sane value if left blank).

Be clear about what this is and isn't: it's a periodic `pg_dump` loop, not a
production-grade backup system. It writes plain dumps to the same host
running Docker Compose, with no off-host copy, no point-in-time recovery,
and no failure alerting - see
[Known Issues: Database backups are scheduled, but not production-grade](../concerns/README.md)
for the specific gaps and what closing them properly would take
(`pgBackRest`/`WAL-G`, an off-host upload step, restore verification). It's
a reasonable baseline for a small/self-hosted deployment, not a substitute
for a real backup tool if your uptime/RPO requirements are strict.

At minimum, copy dumps somewhere durable off the host they're written to
(an object storage sync, a second rsync target, whatever your provider
offers), and periodically test a restore - a backup that only ever lives on
the machine it protects is not a real backup. If you'd rather not run the
sidecar at all, wire `scripts/db/db_backup.sh` into cron, a systemd timer,
or managed Postgres backups instead; a plain crontab entry is the smallest
way to do that on any Linux host, regardless of provider:

```bash
# Edit the crontab for whichever user can run `docker compose` in this repo
crontab -e

# Add a line: daily at 02:00, against the production compose file
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/mystic-auth && scripts/db/db_backup.sh docker-compose.local-prod.yml >> /var/log/mystic-auth-backup.log 2>&1
```

Copy `backups/` (or the single dump the line above just wrote) somewhere off
the host afterward, such as an object storage sync step appended to the same
cron line, since a backup that lives only on the machine it protects is not a
real backup.

Equivalent raw commands, if you'd rather not use the scripts:

```bash
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U $POSTGRES_USER $POSTGRES_DB > backup-$(date +%F).sql
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U $POSTGRES_USER $POSTGRES_DB < backup-2026-07-13.sql
```

---

## Graceful shutdown

`backend/app/main.py` registers a FastAPI `lifespan` handler that runs on
shutdown, including `docker stop` and rolling restarts under an orchestrator. It
disposes the SQLAlchemy connection pool and closes the Redis client cleanly.

---

## Production host requirements

This template assumes a Docker-capable host that can run long-lived services.
Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` when this stack should own the public HTTP/HTTPS
entrypoint through Caddy. Use `docker-compose.local-prod.yml` when another
reverse proxy or TLS terminator sits in front of the stack.

At minimum, a production deployment needs:

- A host that can run Docker Compose continuously.
- Persistent storage for Postgres, Caddy certificates, and Bugsink state.
- Network access for SMTP email delivery.
- DNS pointing at the public host before starting `docker-compose.prod.yml`.
- A backup schedule for Postgres dumps or volume snapshots.
- Monitoring and alerting appropriate for the environment.

The backend, frontend nginx, Postgres, Redis, Procrastinate worker,
Alembic migration runner, and Bugsink services are all included in the Compose
files. The email pipeline depends on the long-running `procrastinate_worker`
service connected to Postgres; request-driven serverless
backend deployments are intentionally out of scope.

---

## Limitations of this deployment approach

- No infrastructure as code is provided. The steps above are manual host setup
  and Docker Compose operations.
- No automated backups are wired up. See
  [Concerns: database backups](../concerns/README.md#database-backups-are-scheduled-but-not-production-grade).
  Error monitoring and alerting are available but opt-in. See
  [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md).
- Capacity planning, host hardening, backups, and alerting remain deployment
  responsibilities outside this template.
