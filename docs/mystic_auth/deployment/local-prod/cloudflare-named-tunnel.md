# Cloudflare Named Tunnel (stable URL)

See [Local-Prod Deployment](README.md) for the mode chooser, environment
variables, and how local-prod differs from dev/prod. This page is the
stable-URL Cloudflare Named Tunnel walkthrough, start to finish.

## Platform setup

Requires a domain added to a free Cloudflare account. The domain's DNS
zone must live in _your own_ Cloudflare account for tunnel routing to
work. A subdomain donated by a third-party registry repo (`is-a.dev`,
`rweb.site`, etc.) will not work here, since Cloudflare Tunnel resolves the
target tunnel by matching the request against Public Hostname config in
the account that owns the zone: a zone you don't control can't route to
a tunnel it doesn't know about. If you don't already own a domain, buying
a cheap one (a few dollars a year, e.g. from Namecheap or Porkbun) and
adding its nameservers to your Cloudflare account is the only way to get
this working.

Cloudflare Named Tunnel uses the same `cloudflared` container as Quick
Tunnel, but it authenticates with a persistent tunnel token:

```yaml
command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token ${TUNNEL_TOKEN}
```

Traffic enters Cloudflare at `https://your-hostname`, then Cloudflare routes
that hostname to the named tunnel, and `cloudflared` forwards it to
`http://frontend:80` inside Docker.

---

**Step 1: Copy the env file.**

```bash
cp env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare.example env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare
```

Same file as [Cloudflare Quick Tunnel](cloudflare-quick-tunnel.md): see Step 1 there for what it
preconfigures. Do not start local-prod from `env/.env.example`; that file is for
the dev stack.

---

**Step 2: Create the tunnel in Cloudflare.**

Zero Trust dashboard → Networks → Tunnels → Create a tunnel → Cloudflared
→ name it. Copy the token shown in the install step into `TUNNEL_TOKEN`
in `env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare`.

---

**Step 3: Point the tunnel at your app.**

Still in that tunnel's config: Public Hostname → Add a public hostname →
your domain or subdomain → Service: HTTP → `http://frontend:80`.

---

**Step 4: Point the app at that hostname.**

In `env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare`, set `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` and `BACKEND_BASE_URL` to
`https://your-hostname` once it's live. Leave `VITE_API_BASE_URL` empty:
frontend and backend share one public origin behind the tunnel, and nginx
(`docker/nginx.frontend.conf`) proxies API prefixes to `backend`
same-origin, so the browser never needs a separate API URL.

Also set `JWT_ISSUER` and `JWT_AUDIENCE` to `https://your-hostname`. They
don't have to match `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` for tokens to work (they're only
checked against themselves, see
[Authentication Overview](../../authentication/overview.md)), but leaving
them at the placeholder default means every deployment that copies this
tutorial mints tokens with the same `iss`/`aud`.

---

**Step 5: Register the hostname with Google and enable Google login.**

In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), under
**APIs & Services**, **Credentials**, your OAuth 2.0 Client ID, add
`https://your-hostname/auth/oauth2/callback/google` under **Authorized
redirect URIs** and `https://your-hostname` under **Authorized
JavaScript origins**. Then set `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` in `env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare` to that
same redirect URI. It must match byte-for-byte, or login fails with
`redirect_uri_mismatch`.

---

**Step 6: Switch the compose file to Named Tunnel mode.**

Edit `docker/compose/docker-compose.local-prod-cloudflare.yml`'s `cloudflared` service `command:`
from the Quick Tunnel form to:

```yaml
command: tunnel --no-autoupdate run --token ${TUNNEL_TOKEN}
```

---

**Step 7: Start (or restart) the stack.**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local-prod-cloudflare.yml --env-file env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare up -d --build
# or: ./scripts/docker/local-prod-cloudflare/local-prod-cloudflare-up.sh
```

Open `https://your-hostname` in a browser: that's your app, live at a
stable address. Unlike Quick Tunnel, this URL doesn't change, so Steps 4
and 5 are one-time setup, not something you repeat on every restart. See
[OAuth2 / PKCE](../../authentication/oauth2-pkce.md#troubleshooting) if login
still fails after this.

---

**Step 7b (Optional): Enable session geolocation.**

Setting `GEOIP_DB_PATH`/`GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID`/`GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY` in
`env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare` alone does nothing: the `geoipupdate` service that downloads the
`.mmdb` file is gated behind the `geoip` Compose profile, skipped by Step 7's
command as written. Re-run Step 7 with the profile added instead:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local-prod-cloudflare.yml --env-file env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare --profile geoip up -d --build
```

Without it, Manage Sessions' Location column silently shows "Unknown" with
nothing in the logs to say why. See
[Session Geolocation](../../geolocation/overview.md)
for the MaxMind account/license-key setup this depends on.

| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cloudflare hostname returns 404 or tunnel not found    | Public Hostname is not attached to the tunnel that owns `TUNNEL_TOKEN`.                        | In Cloudflare Zero Trust, open the tunnel, then verify Public Hostname points to `http://frontend:80`.                |
| DNS does not resolve your hostname                     | Domain nameservers are not delegated to your Cloudflare account or DNS has not propagated yet. | Check the domain in Cloudflare DNS and wait for delegation. New domains can take longer than the tunnel setup itself. |
| `cloudflared` exits immediately                        | `TUNNEL_TOKEN` is missing or invalid.                                                          | Copy the token from the tunnel install step into `env/.env.local-prod-cloudflare`, then restart the stack.            |
| Google login returns `redirect_uri_mismatch`           | Google Cloud Console callback does not match `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`.                            | Register `https://your-hostname/auth/oauth2/callback/google` under Authorized redirect URIs.                          |
| API calls return 502 after changing backend env values | nginx cached the previous backend container IP.                                                | Recreate `backend` and `frontend` together with `--force-recreate`.                                                   |
