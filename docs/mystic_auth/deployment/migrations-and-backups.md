# Migrations and Backups

---

_New to a term here? See the [Infrastructure Glossary](../glossary/infrastructure.md)._

Deployment operations for Alembic migrations, database dumps, restore commands, and backup limitations.

---

## 1. Database migrations

---

The `alembic` service runs `alembic upgrade head` once and exits. In production-shaped Compose files, `backend` and `procrastinate_worker` wait for it with `condition: service_completed_successfully`, so request traffic does not start against an unmigrated schema.

Before applying a migration in production:

1. Review the migration file under `backend/alembic/versions/`.
2. Pay special attention to dropped columns, altered types, data migrations, role changes, and destructive SQL.
3. Confirm the migration has a downgrade only when rollback is actually safe.
4. Run the test suite or at least the migration check in a production-like database copy.

Migrations run with `DATABASE_URL`, normally the Postgres superuser. Runtime app traffic and Procrastinate task bodies prefer `APP_DATABASE_URL`, the least-privilege role created by migration. See [Security Decisions: Least-privilege app DB role](../security/decisions-infra.md#least-privilege-app-db-role-instead-of-running-as-postgres-superuser).

---

## 2. Backup scripts

---

`scripts/db/db_backup.sh` and `scripts/db/db_restore.sh` wrap Docker Compose, `pg_dump`, and `psql`.

```bash
# Dump the dev database and Bugsink database, if enabled
scripts/db/db_backup.sh

# Dump a production-shaped stack
scripts/db/db_backup.sh docker-compose.local-prod-ngrok.yml

# Restore a dump, with confirmation
scripts/db/db_restore.sh backups/mystic_auth-20260717-120000.sql

# Restore without confirmation
scripts/db/db_restore.sh -y backups/mystic_auth-20260717-120000.sql
```

The restore target is inferred from the dump filename. A `bugsink-*.sql` file restores into the `bugsink` database.

---

## 3. Scheduled backup sidecar

---

`docker-compose.prod.yml` and every `docker-compose.local-prod-*.yml` variant run a `db_backup` service by default.

| Setting                 | Purpose                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` | Hours between scheduled dumps.                                                                                                           |
| `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS` | Local retention window for old dump files.                                                                                               |
| `BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND` | Optional shell command run after each verified dump, with `DUMP_FILE` exported to it, to ship the dump off-host. Blank (off) by default. |
| `./backups`             | Host directory where dumps are written.                                                                                                  |

This is a periodic `pg_dump` loop. It is a baseline, not a production-grade backup system. `scripts/db/db_backup.sh` (manual/on-demand backups) honors the same `BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND` for parity.

Example: `BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND=aws s3 cp "$DUMP_FILE" s3://my-bucket/` (the `postgres:15` image has no `aws-cli`/`rclone` preinstalled - use a command already on `PATH`, or bind-mount one in via a custom `db_backup` image).

---

## 4. Backup limitations

---

Known limitations:

1. Dumps live on the same host by default, unless `BACKUP_UPLOAD_COMMAND` is set.
2. There is no point-in-time recovery - periodic full dumps only, so worst-case data loss is up to `BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS` of writes.
3. There is no alert when a scheduled backup or upload fails; a failure is visible only in `docker compose ps`/container logs (`set -e` restarts the container rather than skipping silently).

Each dump is already verified with `pg_restore --list` immediately after writing, so a corrupt dump is caught before it's trusted, not after a restore is attempted.

For production data, periodically restore the latest dump into a scratch database to confirm the whole pipeline works end to end. See [Known Issues](../concerns/README.md#database-backups-are-scheduled-integrity-checked-and-optionally-shipped-off-host-but-theres-still-no-point-in-time-recovery-or-failure-alerting).

---

## 5. Off-host copy without a cloud account

---

If there is no cloud account and no second server, use encrypted removable media as the minimum off-host path.

```bash
# One-time repository setup on mounted removable media
restic -r /mnt/usb-backup/mystic-auth init

# After each backup
restic -r /mnt/usb-backup/mystic-auth backup ./backups
restic -r /mnt/usb-backup/mystic-auth forget --keep-daily 14 --keep-weekly 8 --prune
```

Store the Restic password somewhere separate from the drive, such as a password manager. Disconnect the drive and keep it away from the host when possible.

When a second machine is available, use the same repository model over SFTP:

```bash
restic -r sftp:USER@REMOTE_HOST:/backups/mystic-auth init
restic -r sftp:USER@REMOTE_HOST:/backups/mystic-auth backup ./backups
```

Also keep a recoverable copy of the relevant env file, such as `env/.env.prod` or `env/.env.local-prod-ngrok`. A database dump without `SECRET_KEY`, database passwords, and provider secrets is not enough to recover the application.
