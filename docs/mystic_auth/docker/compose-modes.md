All under `docker/compose/`. Use one of the `docker-compose.local-prod-*.yml`
variants when you want to self-host the production image/runtime shape from
a machine that does not own a public IP, with a free tunnel (Cloudflare,
ngrok, or Tailscale Funnel - see [Local-Prod: which tunnel do I want?](../deployment/local-prod/README.md#which-tunnel-do-i-want))
owning the public URL and TLS. Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` when the host
itself should expose only Caddy on 80/443. See [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md).

## Each compose file is its own Compose project

All five files declare a top-level `name:` (`mystic-auth-dev`,
`mystic-auth-local-prod-cloudflare`, `mystic-auth-local-prod-ngrok`,
`mystic-auth-local-prod-tailscale`, `mystic-auth-prod`). Without it, Compose
derives the project name from the directory (`mystic-auth` for every file
here, since they all live in the same directory), which means every
container, network, and **named volume** (`postgres_data`, `backend_logs`,
...) from any of the five files collides on the exact same name. Two of
these stacks running "side by side" then aren't actually isolated: they
silently share one Postgres volume, so a command that looks scoped to one
stack (`docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down -v`, or even just
recreating a volume to fix a stale password) can wipe what's actually a
different stack's real data. That's a real incident, not a hypothetical: an
early local-prod test environment's database (test users, custom PBAC
policies) was lost exactly this way, mid-session, before this fix.

With each file's `name:` set, `docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
and `docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local-prod-ngrok.yml --env-file env/.env.local-prod-ngrok up -d --build` can run
at the same time on one machine with zero collision - separate containers
(`mystic-auth-dev-postgres-1` vs. `mystic-auth-local-prod-ngrok-postgres-1`),
separate networks, separate volumes. If you have a pre-existing stack from
before this restructure (containers plainly named `mystic-auth-postgres-1`
or `mystic-auth-local-prod-postgres-1`, no tunnel suffix in the name), it's
running under an old project name and is now orphaned from every compose
file's default target - `docker compose -p <old-project-name> -f <old-path>.yml down`
(explicitly naming the old project) stops it; its data volumes
(`<old-project-name>_postgres_data`, ...) survive that and can be inspected
or removed manually once you've confirmed you don't need them.

## Two forks of this template collide with each other too

The isolation above only covers the five compose files _within one checkout_.
It does not cover two separate downstream projects that each independently
started from mystic-auth via "Use this template": both inherit the exact
same literal `name:` defaults above, the exact same host ports (`5433`,
`6380`, `8000`, `5173`, `8010` for dev; `8001`/`8080`, `8101`/`8180`,
`8201`/`8280` for the local-prod tunnel variants), and the exact same Docker
network subnets (`172.27-31.0.0/24`, one per file). If both forks ever run
on the same machine, they collide on all three fronts exactly like the
same-checkout case described above - one fork's `docker compose` commands,
or its containers on the host network, can silently target the other
fork's stack. This isn't hypothetical: it happened during this fix's own
verification, between two real forks on one machine.

Every `name:`, host port, and network subnet/static-IP in
`docker/compose/*.yml` reads from an env var with no fallback
(`${COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME}`, `${POSTGRES_HOST_PORT}`, `${DOCKER_SUBNET}`,
`${FRONTEND_STATIC_IP}`, etc.), set in the matching `env/.env*.example` to
the same literal value the compose file used to hardcode. A fork that needs
to coexist with another on one machine changes `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME`, the
relevant `*_HOST_PORT` vars, and `DOCKER_SUBNET`/the `*_STATIC_IP` vars in
its own `env/.env*` file - see the top of each `env/.env*.example`. The
production/local-prod variants also derive `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` (a
security-relevant anti-spoofing setting - see
[get_client_ip()](https://github.com/Nachiket-2024/mystic-auth/blob/main/backend/mystic_auth/core/client_ip.py)) straight
from those same static-IP vars in the compose file itself, rather than
setting it independently in the env file, so the two can never drift out of
sync (see [get_client_ip()](https://github.com/Nachiket-2024/mystic-auth/blob/main/backend/mystic_auth/auth/security/client_ip.py)).
This is also called out in [overview.md](overview.md)'s fork checklist.
