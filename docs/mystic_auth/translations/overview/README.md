# Translations

The frontend renders in multiple languages via [`react-i18next`](https://react.i18next.com/). This
doc covers what's supported today, how the moving pieces fit together, and a step-by-step
tutorial for adding a new language. See [Frontend Architecture](../../architecture/frontend.md) for
how this fits into the rest of `frontend/src/mystic_auth/`.

## What's supported today

| Language | Code | Native label |
| -------- | ---- | ------------ |
| English  | `en` | English      |
| Hindi    | `hi` | हिंदी        |
| Marathi  | `mr` | मराठी        |
| Gujarati | `gu` | ગુજરાતી      |

The language toggle (`LanguageToggle`, in the navbar next to the dark/light mode toggle) doesn't
just switch between these four - it offers **seven modes**:

| Mode    | What renders in English                    | What renders in the other language                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `en`    | Everything                                 | -                                                       |
| `hi`    | -                                          | Everything, including navbar/sidebar                    |
| `mr`    | -                                          | Everything, including navbar/sidebar                    |
| `gu`    | -                                          | Everything, including navbar/sidebar                    |
| `en+hi` | Navbar, sidebar, and all dates/month names | Page content (titles, forms, tables, messages) in Hindi |
| `en+mr` | Navbar, sidebar, and all dates/month names | Page content in Marathi                                 |
| `en+gu` | Navbar, sidebar, and all dates/month names | Page content in Gujarati                                |

The three mixed modes exist because a caller who's more comfortable navigating in English (menus,
buttons, chrome) may still want the actual content - forms, table data, messages - in their own
language. The plain `hi`/`mr`/`gu` modes are unchanged from a normal single-language app: everything,
chrome included, switches.
