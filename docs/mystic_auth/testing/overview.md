# Testing Overview

---

## Backend: pytest

1. Config lives in `pytest.ini` at the repo root. It sets `testpaths = tests/backend` and collects coverage for `backend/app` and `backend/mystic_auth`.
2. An HTML report is generated in `htmlcov/` on every run.
3. `--cov-fail-under` is not set in `pytest.ini` because it would also apply to partial local runs.
4. CI enforces the 85% cumulative coverage gate after unit, integration, and security tests append to the same coverage data.

---

### Dedicated test database

1. Outside CI, `tests/backend/conftest.py` redirects `DATABASE_URL`/`APP_DATABASE_URL` to a `mystic_auth_test` database on the same Postgres server, instead of the real `mystic_auth` database a running dev session's own `backend`/`procrastinate_worker` containers use.
2. The first run that needs it creates the database, then applies `alembic upgrade head` (which also creates Procrastinate's own queue tables, via migration `a4c1e8f2b6d3`); every run after that is a fast no-op check.
3. Nothing to configure: this happens automatically, whether you run pytest from the host or via `scripts/docker/dev/backend-exec.sh`.

**Why this exists**: a shared database was a real, reproducible bug.

1. A test's own teardown fixture (`_procrastinate_app_lifecycle` below) deletes every row from `procrastinate_jobs` after each test.
2. This used to race a real dev-stack `procrastinate_worker` still mid-write on a job the test itself deferred (an audit-log entry, most commonly): it lost the row it needed to persist "succeeded" against, logged a `ConnectorException`, and enough of those repeated eventually took the container down.
3. A dedicated database removes the shared table entirely, not just this one symptom of sharing it.

**Skipped when `CI` is set** (GitHub Actions and effectively every CI provider sets this by convention): CI already provisions its own dedicated, single-purpose `mystic_auth_ci` Postgres service per run (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`), so there's nothing else there to collide with.

**Running:**

```bash
# From repo root, against local Postgres/Redis (see env/.env)
python -m pytest tests/backend/app -q
python -m pytest tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit -q
python -m pytest tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration -q
python -m pytest tests/backend/mystic_auth/security -q
python -m pytest tests/backend/mystic_auth/performance -q

# Inside the Docker network. This avoids host/container Postgres port conflicts.
# scripts/docker/dev/backend-exec.sh (or .ps1/.cmd) wraps the --user root and
# MSYS_NO_PATHCONV workarounds this needs. See
# docs/mystic_auth/docker/dev-workflow.md#running-a-one-off-command-inside-a-container.
scripts/docker/dev/backend-exec.sh python -m pytest tests/backend/
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs app-wrapper, unit, integration, and
security suites against GitHub Actions service containers (Postgres 15, Redis 7)
on every push and pull request to `main`. App-wrapper and unit tests create the
first coverage base. Integration and security tests pass `--cov-append`, so the
security step can enforce the cumulative `--cov-fail-under=85` gate. Performance
tests also run as non-blocking informational checks because timing is noisy on
shared runners.

## Frontend: Vitest

Config lives in `frontend/vitest.config.ts`. Tests live in `tests/frontend/`
outside `frontend/src/`, wired through a custom Vite resolver plugin. Coverage
uses the `v8` provider with `text`, `json`, and `html` reporters. Thresholds are
enforced only by `vitest run --coverage`, so CI runs `test:coverage`.

**Running:**

```bash
npm run typecheck --prefix frontend   # app, node, and test tsconfigs
npm run lint --prefix frontend        # eslint over frontend/ and tests/frontend/
npm run test --prefix frontend         # vitest run (no coverage collection/thresholds)
npm run test:coverage --prefix frontend  # vitest run --coverage (thresholds enforced)
```

CI runs `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:coverage`, and `build` on every push and pull request to `main`.

---

### `.not` chaining and jest-dom/Vitest type augmentation

`frontend/tsconfig.test.json` uses a shared module-identity `paths` mapping so
jest-dom's Vitest matcher augmentation, such as `toBeInTheDocument()`,
type-checks reliably. That augmentation does not currently extend to chained
`.not.toBe()` or `.not.toBeNull()`. No test in this repo uses `.not.` chaining.
Prefer a positive assertion such as `toBeTruthy()` or an equality check phrased
the other way round.

---

## File length

Source and test files in this repo (backend `.py`, frontend `.ts`/`.tsx`,
everything under `tests/`) are kept to roughly 300-350 lines. This isn't
enforced by a linter/CI gate; it's a convention followed by hand, the same
way `docs/mystic_auth/architecture/frontend.md`'s feature-first folder
layout is a convention rather than a generated structure.

When a file grows past that, split along the same lines the rest of the
codebase already uses, rather than introducing a new pattern:

- **A React page component with a large loaded-state render** (a `*Page.tsx`
  with a big JSX tree beyond data-fetching/orchestration): pull the
  presentational part into its own `*Card.tsx`/component file, the same way
  `dashboard/DashboardIdentityCard.tsx` was split out of `DashboardPage.tsx`
  - see [Frontend Architecture](../architecture/frontend.md). The page keeps
    data-fetching, mutations, and dialog state; the extracted component takes
    plain props and owns only presentation.
- **A backend unit/integration test file covering more than one route or
  concern**: split along the same seam the source side already has - e.g.
  `test_policy_authorization_security_unit.py` (covering both
  `policy_crud_routes.py` and `policy_assignment_routes.py`) became
  `test_policy_crud_authorization_security_unit.py` and
  `test_policy_assignment_authorization_security_unit.py`, matching
  `backend/mystic_auth/api/pbac_routes/`'s own crud-vs-assignment file
  split. Where a test file's own internal `# ---- section ----` comments
  already delimit a natural split (e.g. "Redis fail-open regression
  coverage" in `test_refresh_token_unit.py`), split along those instead of
  inventing a new grouping.
- **Test helpers/fixtures shared across a split** (account creation, polling
  helpers, a `_cleanup_*` autouse fixture): factor them into a sibling
  `*_test_accounts.py` module in the same test directory, matching
  `tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration/user/user_test_accounts.py`
  and `.../audit_log/audit_log_test_accounts.py`. An autouse fixture defined
  there only activates for a test module that imports it by name - keep that
  import (even if otherwise unused, guard it with `__all__` for lint) rather
  than moving the fixture into a directory-wide `conftest.py`, which would
  silently widen its scope to every other test file in that directory.

Leave a one-line pointer at the top of a file that got split (see any of the
files named above) explaining what moved where and why, so a reader who
opens the smaller file isn't left wondering where the rest of the coverage
went.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **A test hangs or cannot connect to Postgres from the host:** see
  [PBAC Troubleshooting: database connection issues](../authorization/troubleshooting/database-connection.md#database-connection-issues).
  A native Postgres install or another project's container can still intercept
  the configured host port.
- **Frontend test cannot resolve a `tests/frontend/...` import:** confirm
  `frontend/vitest.config.ts`'s custom resolver plugin is active. Running Vitest
  from outside `frontend/` bypasses it.
