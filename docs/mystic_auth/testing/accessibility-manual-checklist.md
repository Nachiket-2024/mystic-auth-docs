# Manual accessibility acceptance checklist

---

Automated axe scans are required regression coverage, but they cannot verify
announcement quality, reading order, or every keyboard interaction. Run this
checklist before a public release and after substantial changes to shared UI.
Record the browser, assistive technology, date, and defects found.

## Keyboard-only pass

- [ ] Reach signup, login, password reset, and OAuth controls with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`.
- [ ] Every focused control has a visible focus indicator with sufficient contrast.
- [ ] No focus is trapped in the page shell, navigation, table, drawer, or dialog.
- [ ] Dialogs move focus in, keep focus inside, close with `Escape`, and return focus to the trigger.
- [ ] Visually available actions activate with `Enter` or `Space` as appropriate.
- [ ] Tables, tabs, pagination, filters, and sort controls have an understandable keyboard order.
- [ ] Error messages and validation results are reachable without restarting the flow.
- [ ] At 200% zoom and narrow width, no content or controls disappear.

## Screen-reader pass

Run at least one Chromium or Firefox flow with a supported screen reader. On
Linux, Orca is the documented option; VoiceOver and NVDA are also valid.

- [ ] Signup and login announce labels, required fields, errors, and submit state.
- [ ] Password reset and account deletion confirmation communicate the action and outcome.
- [ ] Navigation announces the current page and expanded/collapsed state where applicable.
- [ ] Dialog title, description, controls, and close action are announced in a useful order.
- [ ] Tabs announce selected state and their associated panel.
- [ ] Loading, success, and failure updates are announced without stealing focus.
- [ ] Tables expose meaningful headers and row actions; icon-only controls have names.
- [ ] The page has one useful main heading and landmarks are not duplicated or misleading.

Do not mark this checklist complete based only on the Playwright axe suite.
