# What the Security Tests Cover

---

_New to a term here? See the [Testing Glossary](../glossary/testing.md)._

This page walks through the dedicated `tests/backend/mystic_auth/security/`
suite, plus other security-relevant behavior tested elsewhere in the
codebase (spoofing, forged tokens, IDOR-style access checks). These tests
try to break the app the way an attacker would, and check it is correctly
blocked. See [Testing Overview](overview.md) for how to run the suite, and
[Security Hardening](../security/hardening.md) for the design decisions
behind these protections.

## Privilege escalation via policies

1. A caller holding only `policies:create` cannot mint a brand-new policy that grants a sensitive action they do not themselves already hold. This closes the obvious path of "create a policy that grants me anything, then assign it to myself."
2. The same guard is tested against `policies:update`: adding an unheld sensitive action to an existing policy is blocked.
3. Self-escalating to system-superuser through a policy assignment is blocked when the caller only holds `policies:assign`.
4. **Two more subtle variants are covered:**
   - Rolling back a policy to a prior revision is blocked if that prior revision holds an action the caller does not currently have: rollback cannot be used as a side door around the same guard that blocks a direct edit. Rolling back a policy the caller does not currently hold is also blocked outright.
   - Repointing a policy's resource type is checked specifically: changing a policy's declared resource type could otherwise "activate" an action that was previously dormant because it never matched anything, and this is blocked the same way a direct action addition would be.
5. A system superuser is checked to still be able to perform every one of the above, confirming the guard is a caller-holds-what-they-grant rule, not a blanket lock that also breaks legitimate superuser administration.

## Privilege escalation via direct permission grants

1. A caller holding only `permissions:grant` cannot grant another user a sensitive action they do not themselves hold, and specifically cannot self-escalate to `users:purge` through the bulk permission-assignment endpoint (a plausible bypass path if bulk assignment used different authorization logic than the single-item endpoint).
2. A bulk assignment containing one item that attempts this escalation still applies the other, valid items in the same batch rather than failing the whole request: the escalation attempt is rejected per-item, not by aborting the batch.
3. A system superuser is checked to still be able to grant permissions normally.

---

## Policy tampering

1. Baseline (built-in, ship-with-the-template) policies cannot be deleted or renamed, even by a system superuser: this protects the policies the rest of the authorization system assumes exist.
2. Removing the last remaining system-superuser assignment is blocked, so it is not possible to lock every admin out of the system by revoking the final superuser grant.
3. See [coverage-authorization/README.md](coverage-authorization/README.md) for the equivalent behavior tested as an ordinary permission boundary; this file tests the same rule as a deliberate attack.

## Condition payload abuse

1. The policy-condition validator is tested as a target for denial-of-service style payloads, not just malformed input: a condition object with a huge number of keys, pathologically deep nesting, or a multi-megabyte string value is rejected quickly, before the validator would otherwise spend excessive time or memory walking the structure.
2. A reasonably-shaped condition still passes through this guard unaffected: the guard is checked to reject only genuinely abusive shapes, not ordinary ones.
3. An unknown condition key is rejected and never persisted to the database, and a malformed time string, invalid IP, or invalid timezone inside a condition is rejected at the API boundary.
4. A final test confirms an existing policy's conditions cannot be corrupted into an invalid shape through an update request: the same validation applies on write, not just on create.

---

## Batch authorization abuse

1. The `/authorize/batch` endpoint is tested against being used as an amplification or information-leak vector:
   - An oversized batch is rejected before any check inside it is evaluated (so an attacker cannot force expensive evaluation work by submitting a huge batch).
   - An empty batch and a batch containing one malformed check are both rejected.
   - The endpoint requires authentication.
2. A denied result inside a batch response is checked to never leak the policy names it considered, only the allow/deny outcome, so a caller cannot use denials to enumerate policy names they cannot read.
3. A batch at the documented maximum size is checked to still succeed and to match what individual single-checks would have returned for the same inputs.

---

## Context spoofing

1. Authorization decisions that depend on request context (like an IP-based policy condition) are tested against a caller forging that context themselves.
2. A forged `X-Forwarded-For` header is checked to never grant access it should not, and to never bypass a denial: only a header contributed by an actually-trusted proxy hop is trusted, matching the client-IP resolution behavior covered in [coverage-authentication.md](coverage-authentication.md).
3. A "current time" value supplied in a request body is checked to never be used for a time-based condition: the server's own clock is always the source of truth, so a client cannot claim it is within business hours when it is not.

---

## Least-privilege database role

1. A separate, opt-in suite (skipped unless `APP_DATABASE_URL` is set to a restricted role) checks the application's own database role against the principle of least privilege: it can read and write the tables the app actually needs, but cannot run DDL (create or alter tables), cannot create or alter other database roles, and is not a superuser role itself.
2. This guards against the app's own database credentials being useful for more than the app needs if they were ever leaked.

---

## Forged and malformed tokens

JWT handling is tested against forged and structurally-wrong tokens throughout the auth suite, not only in this dedicated security folder:

1. A token of the wrong type presented where another type is expected (access token as a refresh token, or a `verify` token as a login token) is rejected.
2. A token whose issuer or audience does not match the configured values is rejected.
3. An expired token is rejected.
4. A token whose account or chain "version" claim is stale (because the account was logged-out-everywhere or reset since the token was issued) is rejected even though the token's own signature and expiry are still valid.

See [coverage-authentication.md](coverage-authentication.md) for the full list of token-handling tests.

## IDOR-style access checks

Several integration tests specifically check that one user cannot act on another user's data by guessing or reusing an identifier:

1. A user cannot revoke another user's session.
2. A deletion-confirmation token issued for one account cannot be used to delete a different account even if replayed directly against the confirm endpoint.
3. Reusing a revoked session's refresh token stays scoped to that one session rather than accidentally validating against a different session.

These are covered in depth in [coverage-users-and-sessions.md](coverage-users-and-sessions.md) and [coverage-authentication.md](coverage-authentication.md).
