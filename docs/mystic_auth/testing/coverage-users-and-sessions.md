# What the User and Session Tests Cover

---

This page walks through what the test suite checks for user CRUD and admin
management, account deletion and purge, the manage-sessions dashboard,
session geolocation, and real-time session events. See
[Testing Overview](overview.md) for how to run the suite.

---

## User CRUD and data model

The base CRUD layer used by every user query is checked directly: search
matches name or email case-insensitively, an empty search term applies no
filter, status filters (active, inactive, deleted) each exclude the rows
they shouldn't include, deleted-only correctly checks `deleted_at` rather
than the active flag, and an unrecognized sort column falls back to sorting
by id instead of raising an error or allowing an arbitrary column name
through (this is also what keeps sorting safe from SQL injection via a
crafted `sort_by` value).

Filtering the user list by policy name and by permission is checked
separately and combined: filtering by permission alone matches a user
either through an assigned policy or a direct grant, and filtering by both
policy and permission together requires both to hold on the very same
assignment, not just any combination.

Email lookups are normalized: `get_by_email` and `create` both lowercase
and match regardless of the input's original casing, so `Test@Example.com`
and `test@example.com` resolve to the same account. The user model itself
is checked for the declared role enum's three roles, that the email column
is unique and indexed, and that new accounts default to unverified and
active.

---

## Admin user management

Admin-only listing and updating of users is checked against permission
boundaries first: an unauthenticated or under-permissioned caller cannot
list all users or update another user's record. Listing is checked for its
filters (role, verification status, active status, policy, permission) and
sort behavior, and that the total-count response header reflects the
filtered total, not just the current page's row count.

The reserved system user gets special protection: an admin cannot modify,
delete, purge, or change the role of the system user, and cannot assign the
system role to any other account. Role changes are checked to actually
apply (an admin can be promoted then demoted back) and to sit alongside
direct permission grants correctly, two users with the identical role can
still end up with different effective permissions if one holds extra direct
grants or policies, and a roleless user assigned admin-level policies gets
admin-level access despite having no role at all.

---

## CSV export

Exporting the user list as CSV is checked for the same permission
boundary (an unauthenticated or regular user cannot export), that the
status filter and deletion flag both carry through into the export
correctly, and that a name containing spreadsheet formula syntax (like a
leading `=`) is neutralized in the exported file so a downloaded CSV cannot
trigger formula injection when opened in Excel or Sheets. A filtered result
set larger than the configured export maximum is rejected rather than
silently truncated.

---

## Self-service profile and password

A regular user can update their own name and email through the
self-service endpoint, including a roleless user with no assigned role at
all. Changing your own password is checked to require and verify your
current password (except for an OAuth-only account setting a password for
the first time, which has none to verify), reject the same password as the
current one, and revoke your other active sessions on success, without
logging out the very session that made the change. If session revocation
cannot be confirmed (a Redis outage), the response still succeeds but
reports that sessions were not confirmed revoked rather than falsely
claiming success. A profile update that does not touch the password does
not revoke any sessions at all.

---

## Account deletion (self-service and admin)

A user can request deletion of their own account, this requires their
current password (again, except for an OAuth-only account) and rejects a
wrong password. The reserved system user cannot self-delete under any
circumstance. Deletion revokes the account's existing sessions and clears
its auth cookies on success, and still soft-deletes the account even if
session revocation cannot be confirmed.

Deletion confirmation tokens (sent by email for the "click to confirm"
flow) are checked to be single-use, scoped to the exact account they were
issued for (a token minted for one account cannot delete a different one,
even if manually replayed against a different account's confirm endpoint),
and rejected outright if garbage or never actually persisted. A concurrent
double-submit of the same confirmation token only lets one deletion through.

Admin-initiated deletion and purge (hard delete after the retention grace
period) are checked against the same system-user protection, an admin
cannot delete their own account either, an admin without the dedicated
purge permission cannot purge, and a purge holder cannot purge their own
account. Purge is checked to invalidate the purged user's authorization
cache entries only after the row is actually deleted (not before, which
would leave a window for a stale cache read), and to return the count of
sessions it revoked unchanged from what the revocation step reported.
Reactivating a soft-deleted user is checked separately, including that
reactivating a user who was never deleted is rejected, and that it requires
its own dedicated permission.

The scheduled purge background job is checked to only purge accounts that
have actually passed the configured grace period, ignore accounts that were
never deleted at all, revoke the purged accounts' sessions as part of the
job, and skip (rather than abort the whole batch on) a single account whose
session revocation cannot be confirmed.

See [Account Deletion](../authentication/account-deletion.md) for the full
flow, and [coverage-security.md](coverage-security.md) for how login,
password change, and deletion lockouts each use their own independent
lockout namespace (so hammering the deletion-confirm endpoint cannot lock
you out of login, and vice versa).

---

## Manage Sessions dashboard

Listing active sessions is checked end to end: a login creates a session
visible in the list, a second login from a different client shows both
sessions with exactly one correctly flagged as the caller's current
session, and logging out removes that session from the active list.

Revoking another device's session is checked to actually end that session
(its refresh token stops working, scoped only to that one session, not the
caller's other sessions), write an audit event, and publish a real-time
event so the affected device is notified live (see "Real-time session
events" below). A user cannot revoke another user's session, and revoking
your own current session through this endpoint is specifically rejected
(logout is the correct action for that). Revoking a session that does not
exist returns 404. If the underlying chain-version bump used to revoke the
session cannot be confirmed, the endpoint returns 503 rather than falsely
reporting success. A concurrency test fires two simultaneous revoke
requests for the same session and checks only one actually succeeds.

See [Session Management](../authentication/session-management.md).

---

## Session geolocation

Login is checked to surface a resolved city and country when the
geolocation lookup is available, and to leave both fields null when
geolocation is disabled, rather than showing stale or fabricated location
data. See [Geolocation](../geolocation/overview.md).

---

## Real-time session events

The server-sent-events (SSE) stream backing live session updates is
checked to publish a revocation event to the affected user's own channel
only, a user's events are scoped so a different user's channel is never
delivered to them, and the stream sends periodic heartbeats while otherwise
idle so a silently dead connection is detectable. Publishing a revoked
event is checked to swallow a Redis error rather than raise, matching the
rest of the system's fail-safe-on-notification pattern.

Connection lifecycle is checked carefully: the stream unsubscribes cleanly
both on a normal close and when server shutdown is signaled mid-stream, an
event that is already in flight when shutdown is signaled is still
delivered rather than dropped, and a long-lived connection is ended
promptly once it reaches its configured maximum connection deadline rather
than being held open indefinitely. Frontend coverage for how the UI
consumes this stream (query invalidation, dropping permissions synchronously
on a `permissions_changed` push) is described in
[coverage-frontend.md](coverage-frontend.md).
