# PBAC Architecture: Frontend Policy Management UI

## Frontend Policy Management UI

The admin-facing policy screens live under `frontend/src/mystic_auth/policies/` and `frontend/src/mystic_auth/users/`, routed at `/policies` (gated by `policies:read`):

The UI is a thin client over the routes above: it does not duplicate the grant-guard or condition logic. `assert_authorized_to_grant` (see [Component Responsibilities: Authorization Service](component-responsibilities.md#authorization-service)) still runs server-side on every create/update/assign, so the form does not need to (and does not) replicate that check.

### Dropdown filtering in the single-user dialogs

`UserPoliciesDialog.tsx` and `UserPermissionsDialog.tsx` both need the same answer to "what's actually new to offer this user", combining two independent grant sources (assigned policies and direct permission grants) before comparing against the full catalog:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": {"lineColor": "#334155"}} }%%
flowchart TD
    Open["Dialog opens for one user"]
    Policies["Assigned policies\n useUserPoliciesQuery"]
    Grants["Direct permission grants\n useUserPermissionsQuery"]
    Build["Effective grant key set\n action/resource_type pairs\n effectiveGrants.ts"]
    Catalog["Full policy list /\n permission catalog"]
    Check{"Candidate adds an\n action outside the\n effective set?"}
    Offer["Offered in dropdown"]
    Skip["Excluded"]
    Open --> Policies --> Build
    Open --> Grants --> Build
    Catalog --> Check
    Build --> Check
    Check -- "yes" --> Offer
    Check -- "no, fully covered already" --> Skip

    classDef blocked fill:#fee2e2,stroke:#dc2626,color:#7f1d1d
    classDef decision fill:#eff6ff,stroke:#3b82f6,color:#1e3a8a
    class Offer success
    class Skip blocked
    class Check decision
    linkStyle default stroke:#334155,stroke-width:2px
```

---

A candidate that grants even one action outside the effective set stays offered, even if it partially overlaps an existing grant - only a candidate that would add nothing new gets excluded. This filtering is a UI convenience only; it has no bearing on what the server ultimately allows or rejects.

See [PBAC Architecture](README.md) for the request flow.
