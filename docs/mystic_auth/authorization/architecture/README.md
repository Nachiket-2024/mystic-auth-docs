Every real (non-hypothetical) authorization decision in the app goes through this exact pipeline, once. Nothing above the Authorization Service reads a user's role, a permission-role mapping, or does its own access comparison: routes only ever declare _what action on what resource type_ they need. Before evaluation, the Authorization Service fetches the caller's active policies through a Redis cache-aside layer (`authorization/repositories/policy_assignment_repository.py`), not straight from Postgres on every call. See [Troubleshooting: Redis cache management](../troubleshooting/redis-and-logging.md#redis-cache-management) for TTL and invalidation rules.
