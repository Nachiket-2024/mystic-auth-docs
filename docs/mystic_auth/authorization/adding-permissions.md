# Adding New Permissions

## Where to define a new action

Add it to the `Permission` enum in `backend/mystic_auth/authorization/permissions.py`:

```python
class Permission(str, enum.Enum):
    ...
    PROJECTS_CREATE = "projects:create"
```

Naming convention: `"<resource>:<action>[_<scope>]"`: e.g. `USERS_UPDATE_OWN` vs `USERS_UPDATE_ANY` are genuinely different actions (a policy can grant one without the other), not one action with a role check bolted on.

**`Permission` is a vocabulary, not a grant.** Adding an enum member here does not give anyone access to anything: it only makes the identifier available for a policy's `actions` list. The only thing that ever grants an action is an assigned, active `Policy` whose `actions` include it.

---

### A note on scope

Every member of `Permission` is treated as one of this app's own **known-sensitive actions**: see `AuthorizationService.assert_authorized_to_grant`'s `_KNOWN_SENSITIVE_ACTIONS` set, which is derived directly from this enum. The check itself lives in `authorization/services/authorization_grant_guard.py::assert_authorized_to_grant`, a module-level function (kept out of `authorization_service.py` to avoid a circular import); `AuthorizationService` re-exposes it as a static method purely so every call site can keep saying `authorization_service.assert_authorized_to_grant(...)`. Adding a permission here means:

- It's subject to the privilege-escalation guard: a caller can never create/update/assign a policy granting this action unless they already hold it themselves.
- It's meant for **this application's own identity/authorization concerns** (user management, policy management). A downstream project's own business-domain actions (e.g. `"documents:view"`, `"projects:create"`) do **not** need to go in this enum at all: policies can grant arbitrary action strings freely, and only strings actually listed in `Permission` are escalation-guarded. Only add an enum member here if the action is sensitive enough that you want that guard to apply.

## How to update seed policies

The three original baseline policies (`self_service`, `user_administration`, `system_superuser`) are seeded by Alembic migrations, **not** read from application code at migration time:

- `backend/alembic/versions/b7d3a1c9e4f2_add_pbac_policies.py`: the original seed.
- `backend/alembic/versions/e2b6c8a4f1d5_split_policies_manage_action.py`: an example of a later **data-only migration** that updated one seeded policy's `actions` array in place.
- `backend/alembic/versions/c4d5e6f7a8b9_grant_rate_limits_read.py` and `backend/alembic/versions/44a59c2f57a3_grant_rate_limits_reset.py`: a more recent pair of data-only migrations, one per new `Permission` member, each granting a single new action to `system_superuser` via `array_append`/`array_remove` rather than restating the whole `actions` array. Same effect as the `sa.table(...)`/`.update()` pattern below, just via a raw `sa.text()` `UPDATE ... SET actions = array_append(actions, ...)`: either form is fine for a single-action grant; prefer the explicit `_NEW_ACTIONS`/`_OLD_ACTIONS` list form above when a migration changes more than one action at once, since `array_append`/`array_remove` calls don't compose as cleanly for a multi-action diff.
- `backend/alembic/versions/e0291417b733_add_five_scoped_policies.py`: seeds five more, non-protected policies the same way (`policy_administration`, `policy_maintainer`, `rate_limit_administration`, `security_audit_administration`, `user_lifecycle_administration`) - each correctly scoped to exactly one `resource_type`, unlike the original mistake this migration's own docstring recounts (grafting cross-resource-type actions onto `user_administration`, which never took effect because its `resource_type` stayed `"users"` - see troubleshooting.md's "UI shows a capability that then 403s" entry). These are migration-seeded purely so they survive a fresh volume/environment the same way the original three do; they are **not** protected (see below) and remain freely editable/deletable through the management API like any policy an operator creates by hand.

This is deliberate: migrations are a historical record and must keep producing the same rows years from now even if `permissions.py`'s constants are later renamed or removed. `authorization/policies/default_policies.py` only holds the three _protected_ baseline policy **name** constants (`SELF_SERVICE_POLICY_NAME`, etc.): used to look up and assign already-seeded policies: never the actual action lists, and never the five extended ones above (those aren't auto-assigned to anyone by default; an operator assigns them deliberately through the Policies page).

**To grant a new permission to an existing baseline policy**, write a new data-only migration (do not edit the old seed migration):

```python
"""add projects:create to user_administration"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa
from sqlalchemy.dialects import postgresql

def upgrade() -> None:
    connection = op.get_bind()
    policies_table = sa.table(
        'policies',
        sa.column('name', sa.String),
        sa.column('actions', postgresql.ARRAY(sa.String())),
    )
    connection.execute(
        policies_table.update()
        .where(policies_table.c.name == 'user_administration')
        .values(actions=['users:list_all', 'users:update_any', 'users:delete_any', 'users:assign_role', 'projects:create'])
    )

def downgrade() -> None:
    # revert to the previous actions list
    ...
```

**To add a brand-new (non-baseline) policy**, just use the management API (`POST /authorization/policies`, requires `policies:create`: see [Policy JSON Examples](policy-examples.md)): no migration needed.

## Migration considerations

- Never edit an already-applied migration's seed data in place: write a new migration.
- A migration that changes a seeded policy's `actions` should also update `downgrade()` symmetrically (restore the previous array) so the migration is safely reversible.
- If you rename or remove a `Permission` enum member that's referenced by a seeded policy, the seeded row's `actions` array (a plain string array in the database, not a foreign key to the enum) is completely unaffected: but update it via a new migration if the old action string should no longer be granted.
- Test new fine-grained actions the same way the existing `policies:read/create/update/delete/assign/revoke` split was tested: real-API integration tests proving a caller holding _only_ the new action can do the one thing it should, and nothing else (see `tests/backend/mystic_auth/integration/authorization/test_policy_action_separation_integration.py`'s `_attempt_policy_routes` pattern).

## Direct grants vs. policies

Most access should go through a `Policy`. But occasionally even the narrowest existing policy still grants more than one specific user should have, and defining a new one-off named policy just for that single case would just recreate RBAC-by-another-name: a pile of single-purpose "policies" that are really just a role for one person. For that case there's `UserPermission` (`authorization/models/user_permission_model.py`): an unnamed, ad hoc `(user, action, resource_type, conditions)` grant, bypassing `Policy` entirely.

Use a direct grant instead of a policy when the access is genuinely one-off for one user (e.g. a single support engineer needs `users:read_own` on one extra resource type temporarily), not when it's a bundle of actions or something you'd want to hand out to more than one person: that's still a policy's job.

Direct grants reuse the exact same `conditions` shape/semantics as `Policy.conditions` (see [Condition Schema Reference](condition-schema-reference.md)), and go through the identical privilege-escalation guard (`assert_authorized_to_grant`) as policy assignment: a caller can never grant an action they don't already hold themselves.

At evaluation time, `PolicyEvaluationEngine` never sees a `UserPermission` row directly. `AuthorizationService._get_effective_policies` fetches a user's assigned policies and active direct grants together, and normalizes each grant into a transient, unpersisted `Policy` object (named `"direct:{action}"`, never `db.add()`-ed) before handing the combined list to the evaluator. So a direct grant flows through the exact same action/resource_type/condition matching as a real policy, and shows up as `direct:{action}` in `matched_policies`/`rejected_policies` on the resulting `AuthorizationDecision`, distinguishable from a real named policy with no schema change.

Managed via `POST`/`DELETE /authorization/users/{email}/permissions` (see `api/pbac_routes/permissions/permission_assignment_routes.py`), or in bulk via `POST /authorization/bulk/permissions/assign` and `/remove` (`api/pbac_routes/bulk/bulk_permission_routes.py`) for granting/revoking the same action to many users at once. In the UI: `users/dialogs/UserPermissionsDialog.tsx` for a single user, the bulk action toolbar's "Grant Permission" dialog for multiple.

An admin never types an action or resource_type by hand: both are picked from `GET /authorization/permissions/catalog` (`authorization/permissions_catalog.py`), a static, code-defined list of every `Permission` enum member paired with the resource_type it's actually checked against and a short description. This is deliberately read-only with no create/edit endpoint: a permission only does something once a route checks for it, so letting an admin invent a new action string would just produce a grant that looks real but never matches anything. Adding a new `Permission` (see above) automatically makes it available to pick from, once you also add its entry to the catalog's `_RESOURCE_TYPE_BY_ACTION`/`_DESCRIPTION_BY_ACTION` maps. `UserPermissionsDialog.tsx`'s picker further excludes any catalog entry the target user already effectively has, whether from a prior direct grant or an assigned policy - see [Architecture Overview: Dropdown filtering in the single-user dialogs](architecture.md#dropdown-filtering-in-the-single-user-dialogs).

The same catalog backs the standalone Permissions page (`permissions/PermissionsPage.tsx`, route `/permissions`), a read-only, browsable reference for the whole action vocabulary - separate from the Policies page so "what permissions exist" and "who has which policy" stay two distinct questions, not one page trying to answer both.

## Roles vs. policies

Roles (`users.role`) are **display/grouping metadata only**: nullable, never read by the authorization service, evaluator, or condition handlers. New users (signup and OAuth2) receive access purely through an explicit `self_service` policy assignment (`authorization_repository.assign_policy_to_user`), never through a default role. If you're tempted to add a role-based shortcut anywhere in the authorization path, don't: see `authorization/services/authorization_service.py`'s own docstring for why.
