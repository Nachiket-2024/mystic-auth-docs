Every real (non-hypothetical) authorization decision in the app goes through this exact pipeline, once. Nothing above the Authorization Service reads a user's role, a permission-role mapping, or does its own access comparison: routes only ever declare _what action on what resource type_ they need. Before evaluation, the Authorization Service fetches the caller's active policies through a Redis cache-aside layer (`authorization/repositories/policy_assignment_repository.py`), not straight from Postgres on every call. See [Troubleshooting: Redis cache management](troubleshooting.md#redis-cache-management) for TTL and invalidation rules.

---

## Component responsibilities

### Authentication

`auth/current_user/current_user_dependency.py`'s `get_current_user` verifies the `access_token` cookie and returns `{name, email, role}`. Authentication answers _who is calling_; it never answers _what they're allowed to do_. `role` here is metadata only: see [Adding New Permissions](adding-permissions.md) for why role never grants access.

---

### Authorization Context Builder

`authorization/context/request_context_builder.py`'s `build_authorization_context(request)` produces the one `context` dict every real authorization check evaluates conditions against:

```python
{
    "ip_address": "203.0.113.7",       # resolved via auth/security/client_ip.py
    "current_time": "2026-07-13T12:00:00+00:00",  # this server's own clock
    "security_context": {},             # reserved for a future trust-signal layer
}
```

**Rule: never trust client-supplied values by default.** `ip_address` is resolved by `auth/security/client_ip.py::get_client_ip`: the literal TCP peer (`request.client.host`) unless the peer itself is listed in `TRUSTED_PROXY_IPS` (`.env`, empty/untrusted by default), in which case the left-most `X-Forwarded-For` entry is trusted instead. `current_time` always comes from this backend's own clock, never anything in the request body or headers. The one deliberate exception is the authorization-check _inspection_ endpoint (`POST /authorization/users/{email}/authorization-check`), which accepts a caller-supplied `context` on purpose: it's a "what would happen if" simulation tool for admins, not a real access decision, so there's nothing to spoof.

---

### Authorization Service

`authorization/services/authorization_service.py`. The single entry point every route/service calls:

- `authorize(user_email, action, resource_type, db, resource=None, context=None) -> bool`: the common case. Thin wrapper over `authorize_with_decision`.
- `authorize_with_decision(...) -> AuthorizationDecision`: computes the decision and writes an audit log entry. `authorize()` is just `.allowed` off of this.
- `authorize_detailed(...) -> AuthorizationDecision`: same computation, **no audit log write**. Used by the admin inspection endpoint and by `authorize_with_decision` internally, so a hypothetical "what if" query never pollutes the real audit trail.
- `authorize_batch(user_email, checks, db, context=None) -> list[AuthorizationDecision]`: fetches the user's policies **once** and evaluates every check against that same list, logging each decision individually. Used by `POST /authorization/batch-check`.
- `require(...)`: same as `authorize()`, but raises `HTTPException(403)` instead of returning `False`. This is what `dependencies/authorization_dependency.py`'s `require_authorization(action, resource_type)` factory calls: the dependency every protected route depends on.
- `assert_authorized_to_grant(caller_email, actions, resource_type, db)`: the privilege-escalation guard: before a policy create/update/assign can hand out one of this app's own sensitive actions (`Permission`'s vocabulary: see [Adding New Permissions](adding-permissions.md)), the caller must already hold it themselves. The implementation is `authorization/services/authorization_grant_guard.py::assert_authorized_to_grant`, a standalone function rather than a method on this class, imported locally inside it to avoid a circular import (`authorization_grant_guard` itself calls back into `AuthorizationService.authorize` to check what the caller holds); `AuthorizationService` re-exposes it as a static method so existing `authorization_service.assert_authorized_to_grant(...)` call sites don't change. Applied symmetrically, not just on the grant side: `update_policy` and `delete_policy` (`policy_crud_routes.py`) call it with the policy's _current_ actions/resource_type before touching it at all, and `remove_policy_from_user` (revoke, `policy_assignment_routes.py`) calls it the same way before removing an assignment. Without the symmetric half, bare `policies:delete`/`update`/`revoke` (without holding what the policy actually grants) could strip, narrow, or repurpose an equally- or more-privileged peer's access, including revoking `system_superuser` off someone else, with no escalation check at all.

---

### Policy Evaluation Engine

`authorization/evaluators/policy_evaluator.py`'s `PolicyEvaluationEngine`. Pure and DB-free: given a user's already-fetched policies plus `(action, resource_type, resource, context)`, it:

1. Filters to policies whose `resource_type` matches (or is `"*"`).
2. Filters to policies whose `actions` list contains the requested action.
3. For each matching candidate, delegates the whole `conditions` block to the Condition Evaluation Service.
4. Builds an `AuthorizationDecision`: `allowed` is `True` iff at least one candidate's conditions passed.

The engine has **zero condition-specific logic**. It doesn't know what `"time"` or `"self_only"` mean: see [Adding New Condition Handlers](adding-condition-handlers.md) for why that separation is deliberate.

---

### Condition Evaluation Service

`authorization/conditions/condition_evaluation_service.py`. Dispatches each key in a policy's `conditions` dict to its registered handler (`authorization/conditions/condition_registry.py`) and ANDs the results. An unrecognized condition key **fails safe (denies)** rather than being silently ignored: a policy can never grant access via a condition the engine doesn't understand.

---

### Authorization Decision

`authorization/evaluators/authorization_decision.py`'s `AuthorizationDecision`: the explainable result object:

| Field                  | Meaning                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed`              | The final decision.                                                                                |
| `evaluated_policies`   | Every policy's name the engine was given, regardless of match.                                     |
| `matched_policies`     | Matched action+resource_type **and** conditions passed: what actually granted access.              |
| `rejected_policies`    | Matched action+resource_type but conditions failed.                                                |
| `failed_conditions`    | `{policy_name: [condition_key, ...]}` for every rejected policy.                                   |
| `denial_reason`        | `None` if allowed; else `"no_assigned_policies"`, `"no_matching_policy"`, or `"condition_failed"`. |
| `evaluation_timestamp` | ISO 8601 UTC, this server's clock.                                                                 |

---

### Audit Log

`authorization/repositories/audit_log_repository.py` + the `authorization_audit_log` table. Every `authorize()`/`authorize_with_decision()`/`authorize_batch()` call writes one row: `allowed`, `candidate_policy_names`, `granting_policy_names`, `failed_conditions`, and the `context` it was evaluated against. Append-only; no update/delete API exists for it. Query via `GET /authorization/audit-log` (requires `policies:read`), `GET /authorization/audit-log/users/{email}` (requires `policies:read`), or `GET /authorization/audit-log/me` (any authenticated caller, their own entries only).

For a single decision (`authorize()`/`authorize_with_decision()`), the row is not written inline: `_log_decision` queues it via `log_authorization_decision_task` (`procrastinate_tasks/audit_log_tasks.py`), and a Procrastinate worker performs the actual insert. `authorize()` itself only waits on the (small, cheap) enqueue, not on the audit row's write; the write is picked up over Postgres `LISTEN/NOTIFY`, typically landing in well under a second. This keeps every protected route's response latency independent of the audit-log commit, which the response never depended on in the first place, while still giving the write Postgres-backed durability (a worker crash retries the job rather than losing the entry, unlike an in-process fire-and-forget task). `authorize_batch()` still writes its rows inline, one bulk insert per batch, since a batch request is already amortizing the cost across up to 50 checks.

---

## Integration points

- **Every protected route** depends on `Depends(require_authorization(action, resource_type))`: see `authorization/dependencies/authorization_dependency.py`. This is the only supported way to gate a route; it builds context and calls `AuthorizationService.require` for you.
- **Policy mutations** (`create`/`update`/`delete`/`assign_policy_to_user`/`remove_policy_from_user` in `authorization/repositories/policy_repository.py`) each: (a) stage a `policy_history` row in the same transaction (see [Writing and Testing Policies](writing-testing-policies.md)), and (b) invalidate the Redis policy cache (see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#redis-cache-management)). `policy_repository.py` owns `Policy` CRUD itself; the user-policy assignment side (`assign_policy_to_user`, `remove_policy_from_user`, `get_active_policies_for_user`, `get_policies_for_user`, `count_assignments`) lives in the sibling `authorization/repositories/policy_assignment_repository.py` and is re-exposed on `policy_repository` as bound static methods, so `policy_repository` stays the one call surface even though the two concerns are file-split.
- **The Batch Authorization API** (`POST /authorization/batch-check`) reuses the exact same `PolicyEvaluationEngine`/`ConditionEvaluationService` calls as a single `authorize()`: it only changes how many times policies are _fetched_ (once per batch, not once per check), never how a decision is computed.

---

## Real-time push

The Redis policy cache above (`authorization/caching/authorization_cache_service.py`) keeps the _server_ correct immediately: the next request after a grant/revoke/update/delete always evaluates against the current policy set, cache or no cache. But a browser tab that already has a permission-gated page open (Policies, Rate Limit Dashboard, a `IfCan`-gated button) has no way to notice a change made from _another_ tab or by an admin elsewhere, short of its own background poll (`useCurrentUserQuery`'s 2-minute `refetchInterval`) or a manual refresh.

This reuses the same per-account SSE channel documented in [Session Management: Real-time push](../authentication/session-management.md#real-time-push) (`GET /auth/session-events`, `session_events:{email}` Redis Pub/Sub) rather than adding a second stream: `user_session/session_events.publish_permissions_changed(email)` is called from every policy mutation that can change what an account is granted. Unlike the `revoked`/`created` events on the same channel, the frontend's `useSessionEventsStream.ts` handler _does_ branch on `type: "permissions_changed"` specifically, because merely invalidating the current-user query left an exploitable gap: a page like Rate Limit Dashboard uses TanStack Query's `placeholderData: keepPreviousData` for smooth pagination, which kept re-rendering its last real cached data as a placeholder on every filter/page click while waiting for the (now-403'ing) request to resolve - repeatable indefinitely on an open tab, since nothing had evicted that cache. On `permissions_changed` the handler instead:

1. Synchronously zeroes out `permissions` in the Zustand `authStore` (`dropPermissions()`), _before_ any network round-trip. `ProtectedRoute`/`IfCan`/the sidebar's nav filter all read permissions reactively from that store, so this alone fails every permission check closed immediately - no cached data, stale or fresh, can pass a check that's already failing.
2. Calls `queryClient.resetQueries()` (not `invalidateQueries`): drops every cached query's data outright, not just marks it stale, so nothing is left over to serve as a `keepPreviousData` placeholder either, and forces an immediate refetch of the real `GET /auth/me` to learn the account's actual new permission list (repopulating it if this was a grant, not a revoke).

`ProtectedRoute` (`authorization/ProtectedRoute.tsx`) also distinguishes _why_ a given render is denied: a route that was already showing (`wasEverAllowed`, tracked via a ref) redirects straight to `/dashboard` - the live-revoke case, no detour through a "you don't have permission" page that would misdescribe what just happened - while a route that was never allowed in the first place (a direct navigation/deep link to something the caller never held) still redirects to `/not-authorized` as before.

- **Assign/revoke** (`assign_policy_to_user`/`remove_policy_from_user`, `api/pbac_routes/policy_assignment_routes.py`) know the single affected `user_email` already, so each publishes to just that one channel after its own cache invalidation and audit log write.
- **Update/delete/rollback** (`policy_crud_routes.py`'s `update_policy`/`delete_policy`, `policy_history_routes.py`'s `rollback_policy`) can change what _every_ current holder of that policy is granted, all at once. Each fetches the holder list first (`policy_repository.get_holder_emails`, since a definition change, a cascade-delete, or a restore don't otherwise leave a way to know who held it), then fans out `publish_permissions_changed` to every one of those emails via `asyncio.gather` after the mutation succeeds. `update_policy` only does this when the change could actually alter access (`actions`/`resource_type`/`is_active` in the patch). A pure description/conditions edit, or reactivating via `is_active=True`, doesn't change what any holder is granted, so it skips the fan-out. `delete_policy` and `rollback_policy` always fan out: a delete always removes every holder's access, and a rollback's restored snapshot always includes `actions`/`resource_type`/`is_active` (the full definition, not a partial patch).
- **The published event is deliberately minimal** (`{"type": "permissions_changed"}`), the same "something changed, go check now" contract as the session-revoked/session-created events on this channel: never an authoritative new permission set on its own. `dropPermissions()` is a fail-closed _assumption_ ("holds nothing until proven otherwise"), not the real answer - the receiving tab's `GET /auth/me` is still what actually decides what it can do, and self-corrects the optimistic empty list a moment later.
- **Best-effort, like every publish on this channel**: a Redis hiccup here is logged and swallowed, never turning a successful policy mutation into a failed request. The 2-minute background poll on `useCurrentUserQuery` remains the fallback for a silently dropped SSE connection.

Direct permission grants (`UserPermission`, bypassing `Policy` entirely) are covered in [Adding New Permissions: Direct grants vs. policies](adding-permissions.md#direct-grants-vs-policies), including how `AuthorizationService._get_effective_policies` normalizes them into the same evaluation path as a real policy. The bulk endpoints above apply one operation (policy assign/remove, permission grant/remove, or role set) to many target users in a single request; each accepts a list of targets and returns one per-item success/error result rather than failing the whole batch on one bad target, all committed in a single transaction per batch.

## Frontend Policy Management UI

The admin-facing policy screens live under `frontend/src/mystic_auth/policies/` and `frontend/src/mystic_auth/users/`, routed at `/policies` (gated by `policies:read`):

The UI is a thin client over the routes above: it does not duplicate the grant-guard or condition logic. `assert_authorized_to_grant` (see "Authorization Service" above) still runs server-side on every create/update/assign, so the form does not need to (and does not) replicate that check.

### Dropdown filtering in the single-user dialogs

`UserPoliciesDialog.tsx` and `UserPermissionsDialog.tsx` both need the same answer to "what's actually new to offer this user", combining two independent grant sources (assigned policies and direct permission grants) before comparing against the full catalog:

```mermaid
%%{init: {"themeVariables": {"lineColor": "#334155"}} }%%
flowchart TD
    Open["Dialog opens for one user"]
    Policies["Assigned policies<br/> <small>useUserPoliciesQuery</small>"]
    Grants["Direct permission grants<br/> <small>useUserPermissionsQuery</small>"]
    Build["Effective grant key set<br/> (action, resource_type) pairs<br/> <small>effectiveGrants.ts</small>"]
    Catalog["Full policy list /<br/> permission catalog"]
    Check{"Candidate adds an<br/> action outside the<br/> effective set?"}
    Offer["Offered in dropdown"]
    Skip["Excluded"]

    class Check decision
    linkStyle default stroke:#334155,stroke-width:2px
```

A candidate that grants even one action outside the effective set stays offered, even if it partially overlaps an existing grant - only a candidate that would add nothing new gets excluded. This filtering is a UI convenience only; it has no bearing on what the server ultimately allows or rejects.
