# How It Evolved

---

Companion to the [Project Story](../README.md). That page covers _why_ this exists and how its
architecture settled into its current shape; this one is the day-by-day (well, commit-by-commit)
log of what actually happened, split out on its own since it only ever grows longer while the rest
of the story doesn't.

The commit history shows the real evolution, not a fully planned architecture from day one. The
first commit was on 18 August, 2025, the most recent below on 4 September, 2026. There's a 4-month
gap between October 2025 and February 2026. Below, days committed back-to-back are grouped into
one range while an isolated day stands on its own.
