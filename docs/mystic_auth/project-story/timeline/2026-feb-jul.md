### Commit 37: 21 February, 2026

`3e4a3a5`: "Fixed Oauth2 login flow"

- Work resumed after the 4-month gap by fixing the OAuth2 login flow, which hadn't been fully solid before the break.
- The standalone `docker/nginx/` container (its own `Dockerfile` + `nginx.conf`) was also dropped in the same commit: nginx's job folded into the frontend container instead.

### Commit 39: 27 February, 2026

`40b816f`: "Signup, Login, Verify Account, Dashboard pages updated with Chakra UI"

- `SignupForm.tsx` rewritten most heavily (315 lines changed).
- `OAuth2LoginButton.tsx` split into logic + a new `OAuth2LoginButtonComponent.tsx`, matching the logic/presentation split `LogoutButton`/`LogoutAllButton` already used.

### Commit 40: 28 February, 2026

`d17f740`: "Dashboard page modified to show user details ;Sign up page updated"

- Dashboard page modified to show real user details (173 of the 177 changed lines landed here).
- Signup page updated to match.
- Redux was still the frontend state management foundation at this point, and the frontend was moving toward feature-based organization mirroring the backend: auth, dashboard, and profile.

### Commit 41: 12 April, 2026

`7c06836`: "Refactored role-based tables into a single users table with role enum"

- `access_control/role_checker.py`, `role_permissions.py`, and `role_tables.py` deleted.
- The single generic `role_routes.py` (234 lines) deleted, replaced by `api/user_routes/user_routes.py` (325 lines, new).
- `roles/admin/`, `roles/role1/`, `roles/role2/` model/schema files all deleted, replaced by one `user_table/user_model.py` (82 lines) + `user_schema.py` (87 lines), plus a new `user_crud_modules/user_role_crud.py` (84 lines).
- `scripts/create_system_user.py` added (84 lines): the reserved system-superuser account, since a single-table role model needs one account that can't be demoted by mistake.

### Commit 42: 14 April, 2026

`1943f16`: "Added forgot password frontend and improved backend password reset validation"

- A new password-reset-request flow and its own page/form/slice landed (previously reset relied on a single combined flow).
- Nearly every existing auth flow file touched to route through it (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`, `current_user_slice.ts`, login/logout/logout-all/OAuth2/signup/verify-account).
- `PasswordResetConfirmForm.tsx` alone changed by 343 lines.
- The larger of the two password-reset commits.

### Commit 43: 14 April, 2026

`946e384`: "Enhanced emails with HTML templates, added cooldown to password reset, fixed loading flashes"

- `taskiq_tasks/email_tasks.py` grew to render HTML rather than plain text.
- `password_reset_service.py` and `account_verification_service.py` both picked up the cooldown logic.
- `PasswordResetRequestForm.tsx` grew by 56 lines to show it.

### Commit 44: 14 July, 2026

`a66bc91`: "Added PBAC, audit logging, security hardening, frontend updates, CI, tests, and docs"

After a 3-month gap, the biggest single change in the project's history: 364 files touched.

1. **RBAC → PBAC.** Authorization decisions moved off a role column onto assigned policies, allowed actions, resources, and optional conditions; roles became descriptive metadata rather than the source of truth for permissions. Not part of the original design: RBAC was built first, before the frontend existed, then replaced for clearer and more granular permissions. Since the RBAC UI wasn't done yet and the backend RBAC work was minimal, switching didn't break much, and it was worth doing early rather than retrofitting later.
2. Audit logging added.
3. Security hardening, headers and middleware, and cookie/security handling strengthened.
4. CI/CD pipelines set up.
5. Extensive backend and frontend testing added.
6. Broad documentation written.
7. Frontend state management redesigned: Redux replaced with Zustand (client state) and TanStack Query (server state).

### Commit 45: 18 July, 2026

`291f3f9`: "Updated documentation, fixed audit findings, and improved app configuration"

- A couple of real session/token bugs fixed: a roleless OAuth2 account getting logged out on refresh, a race condition in refresh-token rotation, an expired-token cleanup that never ran (visible in `jwt_service.py`'s 95-line change and `refresh_token_service.py`'s 52-line change).
- A password-change flow that now asks for the current password and logs out other sessions.
- A handful of smaller admin/config fixes.
- `emails/email_sender.py` introduced (47 lines) to isolate the SMTP transport behind its own module.
- CI got a real coverage gate and dependency scanning for the first time (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` +45 lines).
- `docs/project-story/README.md` (382 lines) and `docs/template-usage.md` (143 lines) both written for the first time in this commit (this is where the project story and template-usage docs actually began).
- The known-issues doc trimmed down to what was still actually true.

### Commit 46: 20 July, 2026

`bc8a43f`: "Added Bugsink error monitoring, SDK, restructured frontend; fixed logout, rate limits."

- Running the template against other projects surfaced a couple of small logout and rate-limiter bugs, fixed here: the kind of thing real usage catches that reading the code alone wouldn't.
- Self-hosted error monitoring landed via a new `error_monitoring/sentry_service.py` (110 lines) and frontend `core/errorMonitoring.ts` (46 lines), backed by Bugsink, so real errors get logged somewhere instead of just showing up in server logs.
- `backend/app/sdk.py` (52 lines) and `frontend/src/sdk.ts` (40 lines) introduced: a single file on each side re-exporting the pieces meant to be built on, so future code doesn't have to reach into the template's internals directly.
- The frontend's flat `components/` folder split into top-level `authorization/`, `layout/`, and `ui/` folders, reorganized into proper feature folders.

### Commit 47: 25 July, 2026

`41f43dc`: "Restructured with app/mystic_auth split, sync script, diagrams, env defaults"

- The code split into upstream-owned internals (`backend/mystic_auth/`, `frontend/src/mystic_auth/`) and thin project-owned shells (`backend/app/`, `frontend/src/app/`), with `sdk.py`/`sdk.ts` and `app_sdk.py`/`app_sdk.ts` as the extension surface.
- Docs and tests split the same way.
- `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` added for future template updates.
- Diagrams and env defaults added.
- This is where the repo turned from "reusable codebase" into a real template, mainly because of running it against real downstream projects.

### Commit 48: 26 July, 2026

`55907ed`: "Fixed password hash error handling, enabled Bugsink in prod, updated deps and docs"

- Password hash error handling fixed.
- Bugsink enabled in production (`docker-compose.prod.yml` +75 lines).
- Dependencies and docs updated.
- `scripts/test-sync-upstream.sh` (168 lines) added as the sync script's own regression suite.
- `docs/template-usage.md` substantially rewritten (327 of its lines changed).

### Commit 49: 27 July, 2026

`c191f46`: "Added sidebar/SDK extension, multi-origin CORS, Docker CI, and docs fixes"

- `create_system_user.py` grew by 135 lines, and `docs/authentication/system-superuser.md` (72 lines) documented it for the first time.
- `docs/authorization/common-patterns.md` (41 lines) and `docs/docker/validation-history.md` (47 lines) added.
- `docs/template-usage.md` (287 lines) deleted and split into `template-usage/overview.md`, `syncing-upstream.md`, and `worked-example.md`: the first page-per-topic split of what had been one long file.
- `docs/project-story/tools.md` written for the first time (45 lines): "the tools that built it" page.
- CI workflow grew by 156 lines, and `layout/AppLayout.tsx`/`Sidebar.tsx`/`navItems.ts` picked up the sidebar extension points.

### Commit 50: 27 July, 2026

`d608134`: "Unblocked JWT calls in password reset, added RBAC doc/seed, restructured tests, updated docs"

- JWT calls unblocked in the password reset flow.
- An RBAC quickstart doc/seed added (`scripts/create_rbac_policies.py`, 101 lines; `docs/authorization/rbac-quickstart.md`, 51 lines).
- The entire backend unit test suite restructured: `tests/backend/mystic_auth/unit/` moved from one flat folder into per-feature subfolders (`api/`, `auth/login/`, `auth/logout/`, `auth/oauth2/`, `authorization/`, `core/`, `error_monitoring/`, `logging/`, `scripts/`, `user_crud/`, and more): 85 files touched, nearly all of them pure moves with no content change.

### Commit 51: 28 July, 2026

`b66c63a`: "Added dev-up.sh, fixed Bugsink timeout, and fixed script permissions"

- `scripts/dev-up.sh` added (99 lines) as the quieter default startup path.
- A Bugsink Gunicorn timeout fixed.
- The executable bit restored on `db_backup.sh`/`db_restore.sh`/`sync-upstream.sh`/`test-sync-upstream.sh`: script permissions had silently reverted, the first appearance of the `core.filemode=false` problem this repo's sync tooling would later check for automatically.

### Commit 52: 28 July, 2026

`8771eb3`: "Upgraded react-router v8 (CSRF fix), fixed DSN race and logging mismatch"

- Caught an `sdk.ts` import bypass.
- Fixed an event-loop-blocking token signature.
- Fixed a deployed OAuth redirect gotcha.
- The stale `react-router-dom` package carrying an unpatched advisory replaced by moving to `react-router` v8, and `npm audit` made blocking again.
- Heavy touch across frontend layout/ui components, integration tests, and the authorization condition modules.

### Commit 53: 29 July, 2026

`50a04d5`: "Added and integrated resend-verification email flow with taskiq logging, fixed dev-up scripts"

- A resend-verification email flow added and integrated for users who tried to verify their account after the link had expired: a new `VerificationEmailRequestForm.tsx` (82 lines) and `useVerificationEmailRequestMutation.ts` (21 lines) on the frontend, matching backend changes to `account_verification_handler.py`/`service.py` and `verify_account_schema.py`.
- The background email worker got terminal-visible logging (`logging_config.py` +49 lines).
- A PowerShell `dev-up` bug fixed (plus a new `dev-up.cmd`) so the startup logs it always promised actually showed up.
