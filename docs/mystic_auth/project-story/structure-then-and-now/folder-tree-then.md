# Structure: Then (14 April, 2026)

One Python package, one npm package, no docs folder, no tests folder, no CI.

A single `backend/app/` and `frontend/src/` held everything: no upstream/downstream split, no
`sdk.py`/`sdk.ts`, no `mystic_auth` package name yet. Redux was still the frontend state manager.
Access control was role-based (a `role` column on the `users` table), not policy-based. There was
no `tests/` folder, no `docs/` folder, and no CI workflow: verification was manual, screenshots
lived in `demo_assets/`, not `screenshots/`.
