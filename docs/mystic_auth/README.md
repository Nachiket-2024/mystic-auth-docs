# Documentation

---

Documentation for this full-stack authentication and PBAC template, organized by feature and runtime ownership. The structure mirrors the code layout under `backend/mystic_auth/<domain>/` and `frontend/src/mystic_auth/<domain>/`.

This is the template's own reference documentation, belonging to upstream and not yours to edit. Your own project's docs go in [`docs/app/`](../app/README.md) instead, so they never conflict with a future `scripts/upstream-sync/sync-upstream.sh` run. See [Using This Repository as a Template: the `app/` + `mystic_auth/` split](template-usage/overview.md#the-app--mystic_auth-split) for the full reasoning.

Read the docs in this order if you are new to the repository:

1. [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md)
2. [Authentication Overview](authentication/overview.md)
3. [Authorization Architecture](authorization/architecture/README.md)
4. [Deployment Guide](deployment/guide.md)
5. [Testing Overview](testing/overview.md)

## Who this is for

Anyone adding a new protected endpoint, a new permission, a new condition type, or a new policy to this template; anyone integrating a new frontend feature against the API; anyone debugging why an authorization decision or a request came back the way it did; or anyone new to the codebase who needs the system-wide picture before touching auth, authorization, or infrastructure code.

---

## Source of truth

This documentation describes the code as it exists in `backend/mystic_auth/` and `frontend/src/mystic_auth/` at the time of writing. If something here disagrees with the code, the code wins.
