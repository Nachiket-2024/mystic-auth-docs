# Documentation

---

Documentation for this full-stack template, organized by feature/domain to mirror the actual code layout (`backend/mystic_auth/<domain>/`, `frontend/src/mystic_auth/<domain>/`). If something here disagrees with the code, the code wins, so file an issue or update the doc.

This is the template's own reference documentation, belonging to upstream and not yours to edit. Your own project's docs go in [`docs/app/`](../app/README.md) instead, so they never conflict with a future `scripts/upstream-sync/sync-upstream.sh` run. See [Using This Repository as a Template: the `app/` + `mystic_auth/` split](template-usage/overview.md#the-app--mystic_auth-split) for the full reasoning.

## Architecture

- [System Overview](architecture/system-overview.md): whole-stack component diagram, why the stack is split this way, request lifecycle
- [Backend Architecture](architecture/backend.md): `backend/mystic_auth/` module layout, request pipeline, middleware
- [Frontend Architecture](architecture/frontend.md): `frontend/src/mystic_auth/` module layout, state management, routing, theming

## Who this is for

Anyone adding a new protected endpoint, a new permission, a new condition type, or a new policy to this template; anyone integrating a new frontend feature against the API; anyone debugging why an authorization decision or a request came back the way it did; or anyone new to the codebase who needs the system-wide picture before touching auth, authorization, or infrastructure code.

---

## Source of truth

This documentation describes the code as it exists in `backend/mystic_auth/` and `frontend/src/mystic_auth/` at the time of writing. If something here disagrees with the code, the code wins.
