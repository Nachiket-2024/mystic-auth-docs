# Appearance: Per-User Brand Color

---

_New to a term here? See the [Frontend Glossary](../glossary/frontend.md)._

Lets a signed-in user pick their own brand accent color from Account Settings, re-skinning buttons, focus rings, the page-background gradient, the in-app logo badge, and the browser-tab favicon for themselves, on any device they sign into. This is separate from the app-wide default brand color (`BRAND_COLOR`/`VITE_BRAND_COLOR`, see below), which is what every user starts from. A user's own pick, once saved, overrides that default client-side, only for them; it never changes what anyone else sees.

---

## Default brand color

The app-wide default is one env var, not a code edit: `BRAND_COLOR` in the root `.env` (aliased to `VITE_BRAND_COLOR` for the frontend build, the same pattern `APP_NAME` uses, see [Using This Repository as a Template: Environment configuration](../template-usage/overview.md#environment-configuration)). Ships as amber. `frontend/src/mystic_auth/core/settings.ts` reads it (falling back to that same amber if unset), and `frontend/src/mystic_auth/theme/system.ts` feeds it through `generateBrandScale`, the same generator described below, to build the whole `brand` token scale plus the canvas-gradient tint, merged into the base theme before `frontend/src/app/theme.ts`'s own overrides (empty by default) and before a signed-in user's own pick.

Need more than a single color, for example a hand-authored scale that doesn't fit the generator's lightness ladder? `frontend/src/app/theme.ts` still exists for that; see [Frontend Customization: Theme](../template-usage/frontend-customization.md#frontend-customization-1).

## Why the system gets rebuilt, not CSS variables overridden

An earlier version of this feature tried to apply a picked color by overriding Chakra CSS variables after the fact, and silently failed to apply dark-mode values. `AppearanceThemeProvider.tsx` instead rebuilds Chakra's `system` itself (`buildSystem` from `theme/system.ts`, merged with `buildAppearanceThemeOverrides`'s `SystemConfig` fragment) on every `brandColor` change, wrapped in `useMemo` so unrelated re-renders don't pay for it. `buildAppearanceThemeOverrides` returns `null` when nothing is customized, so the overwhelmingly common case (no per-user color set) reuses the shared default `system` object with zero extra work.

Because `AppearanceCard.tsx` reads and writes the same store `AppearanceThemeProvider` subscribes to, every pick applies live across the whole app immediately: there is no separate preview mechanism to keep in sync. The color picker's own preview boxes call `generateBrandScale`/`deriveCanvasFrom` directly, so what's shown on the card is provably the same output the rest of the app will render, not an approximation of it.

---

## Color scale generation

`generateBrandScale(hex)` (`theme/generateBrandScale.ts`) keeps the picked color's hue (and roughly its saturation) fixed, and interpolates lightness across a `LIGHTNESS_LADDER` calibrated against the shipped default's amber scale (Tailwind's amber scale), so an arbitrary input hue lands at roughly the same visual weight and contrast per step as that hand-tuned scale, without per-color manual re-tuning. Saturation is tapered slightly at the darkest steps (`SATURATION_MULTIPLIER`) so `900` doesn't read as an oversaturated near-black. `contrastRatio(a, b)` (WCAG contrast, via the `colord` `a11y` plugin) backs `AppearanceCard.tsx`'s low-contrast warning, checked against `scale["600"]` on white.

The page background gradient's start color (`bg.canvasFrom`, the semantic token every `AppLayout`/`AuthLayout`/`LandingPage` gradient reads) is derived from this same scale rather than picked separately: `brand.100` in light mode, and a 65/35 blend of Chakra's stock `gray.900` with `brand.900` in dark mode (`deriveCanvasFrom` in `appearanceThemeOverrides.ts`), the same function `theme/system.ts` calls to build the app-wide default's canvas tint from `BRAND_COLOR`. A flat `brand.900` wash read as too strong at the top of a dark viewport; plain gray alone read as unbranded. `bg.canvas`, `bg.canvasTo`, and `bg.surface` stay at their stock values in both modes; only the gradient's start color moves with the user's pick.

## Applying and persisting a pick

1. **Every drag/keystroke on the picker** updates `AppearanceCard`'s own local `draftBrand` state immediately (cheap, local only), so the swatch and this card's own preview boxes track the pointer with no lag.
2. **Committing to `appearanceStore`** (which triggers the expensive `AppearanceThemeProvider` system rebuild) is debounced 100ms (`COMMIT_DEBOUNCE_MS`). Committing on every single `input` event while dragging the native color picker's saturation/hue square previously blocked the main thread continuously: Chromium's built-in color picker popup shares the page's renderer process, so a busy main thread stalls the picker's own drag tracking too, not just React's re-render.
3. **Save** (`handleSave`) commits the debounced value immediately, then calls `PUT /users/me` with `{ brand_color: draftBrand }` via `useUpdateMyAccountMutation`, which invalidates the current-user query on success.
4. **Reset** (`handleReset`) sets the local store back to `null` (the app-wide default from `BRAND_COLOR`, shown in the picker) and calls `PUT /users/me` with `{ brand_color: null }`, clearing the stored override.
5. Both mutations reuse the same `PUT /users/me` route self-service name/password changes go through; a `brand_color` change alone never rotates session cookies (only a password change does, see `sessionRotationGuard.ts`).

### Reconciliation on login and across devices

The store's `initialBrandColor` (read from `localStorage` at module load, before React's first paint, same as `themeStore.ts`'s color-mode handling) is only ever a locally cached guess, applied eagerly so there's no flash of the default color before the app finishes loading. `useAuthSession` (`useCurrentUserQuery.ts`) is the source of truth: once `GET /auth/me` resolves, it calls `appearance.setBrandColor(data.brand_color ?? null)` with the server's real, stored value, overriding whatever the local cache guessed, e.g. after picking a color on another device, or on a browser that never set anything locally. On a failed/expired session, it resets to `null` (the app default) the same way.

---

## Production checks

- Backend unit tests cover `UserUpdate.brand_color`'s hex-format validation and the `PUT /users/me` handler's null-reset behavior.
- Frontend unit tests cover `generateBrandScale`'s output shape and `contrastRatio`, and `AppearanceCard.tsx`'s debounced commit, save, and reset flows.

---

## Where to go next

- [Frontend Customization](../template-usage/frontend-customization.md): the app-wide default brand color (`app/theme.ts`) this feature overrides per user.
- [Frontend Architecture](../architecture/frontend.md): where `theme/` and `store/` fit into the rest of `frontend/src/mystic_auth/`.
