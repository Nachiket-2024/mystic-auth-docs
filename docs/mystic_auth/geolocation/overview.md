# Session Geolocation

---

_New to a term here? See the [Operations Glossary](../glossary/operations.md)._

Off by default. Resolves each login's city/country from its IP for the "Manage Sessions" dashboard's Location column, so a user (or an admin looking at someone else's sessions) can tell "Sydney, Australia" from "an unfamiliar location" at a glance, rather than staring at a bare IP address.

---

## How it works

`backend/mystic_auth/user_session/session_geolocation.py` resolves the lookup from a local **MaxMind GeoLite2-City** database (`geoip2` library reading a `.mmdb` file), not a third-party HTTP API: the lookup is offline and sub-millisecond, so it adds no latency, no rate limit, and no external outage dependency to the login/refresh path.

Leaving `GEOIP_DB_PATH` empty (the default) disables the feature entirely: `resolve_city_country` returns `(None, None)` for every lookup, and the Location column shows "Unknown", the same fail-open posture as every other best-effort field on `UserSession` (see `session_service.py`). Nothing else in the app depends on it.

---

## Enabling it under Docker

Every production-style Compose file (`docker-compose.prod.yml`, and each `docker-compose.local-prod-*.yml` tunnel variant) ships an optional `geoipupdate` service (MaxMind's own official updater, not a hand-rolled cron script) that downloads `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` into a `geoip_data` volume also mounted read-only into `backend`, and keeps re-checking for a new database on its own schedule (`GEOIPUPDATE_FREQUENCY`, in hours) for as long as the container runs. The file never goes stale without anyone having to remember to refresh it by hand.

It's gated behind the `geoip` Compose profile, so it never starts (and never restart-loops on missing credentials) unless explicitly enabled:

---

1. Create a free MaxMind account: [https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup) (email + password, no payment info, no trial period; GeoLite2 is free). Verify your email via the link MaxMind sends before the account is usable.

---

2. Log in at [https://www.maxmind.com/en/account/login](https://www.maxmind.com/en/account/login). The account dashboard shows a numeric **Account ID**, that's `GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID`.

---

3. In the left sidebar, go to **Manage License Keys** → **Generate new license key**. When it asks whether the key is for use with `geoipupdate`, say yes (this changes the key's format/permissions to match). Copy the key immediately: MaxMind only shows it once. That's `GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY`.

---

4. In `env/.env.prod` (or your mode's `env/.env.local-prod-*`, whichever you're running), set `GEOIPUPDATE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY` to those two values, and set `GEOIP_DB_PATH=/usr/share/GeoIP/GeoLite2-City.mmdb` (the path `geoipupdate` writes to inside the shared volume).

---

5. Start (or restart) the stack **with the profile enabled**. This is the step it's easy to miss, since nothing about steps 1-4 warns you it's still required:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file env/.env.prod --profile geoip up -d --build
   ```

   (swap in your tunnel's `docker-compose.local-prod-*.yml` and matching `env/.env.local-prod-*` for local-prod). Without `--profile geoip`, `geoipupdate` is skipped entirely and `backend` just mounts an empty volume, harmless, same as `GEOIP_DB_PATH` being unset, but silently so: nothing logs a warning that you configured credentials for a service that never started.

---

6. `geoipupdate` needs one successful run before the file exists; `backend`'s Location column shows "Unknown" until then, same as any other missing-database state. Check it landed:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local-prod-ngrok.yml --env-file env/.env.local-prod-ngrok exec geoipupdate ls -la /usr/share/GeoIP/
   ```

   and expect a ~60MB `GeoLite2-City.mmdb`. If `backend` was already running when the file appeared, restart it: it only checks for the file at startup, not on every request:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker/compose/docker-compose.local-prod-ngrok.yml --env-file env/.env.local-prod-ngrok restart backend
   ```

See [Docker Overview: services](../docker/overview.md#services) for where `geoipupdate` fits among the rest of the stack, and the deployment walkthroughs ([Prod](../deployment/prod.md), and local-prod's [Quick Tunnel](../deployment/local-prod/cloudflare-quick-tunnel.md), [Named Tunnel](../deployment/local-prod/cloudflare-named-tunnel.md), [ngrok](../deployment/local-prod/ngrok-tunnel.md), [Tailscale Funnel](../deployment/local-prod/tailscale-funnel.md)) for this as a step in context.

---

## Enabling it outside Docker

1. Create a MaxMind account and license key the same way as steps 1–3 above.
2. Download `GeoLite2-City.mmdb` yourself (MaxMind's license does not permit redistributing the file itself, so it can't ship in this repo), and set `GEOIP_DB_PATH` to that file's path.
3. Keep it current yourself. MaxMind publishes updates roughly weekly; run their [`geoipupdate`](https://github.com/maxmind/geoipupdate) CLI tool on a periodic schedule (e.g. a system cron job) rather than the Docker service above.

## Security notes

- **The `.mmdb` file itself carries no secrets.** It's a public geo-IP dataset, safe to have on disk unencrypted. What's sensitive is `GEOIPUPDATE_LICENSE_KEY`, which is tied to your MaxMind account: treat it like any other credential in `.env.prod`/`.env.local-prod`, not something to commit or share.
- **Resolution is IP-only, best-effort, and never blocks auth.** A failed or missing lookup degrades to "Unknown," never to a login/refresh failure, see `session_geolocation.py`'s own fail-open handling and the module-level `_get_reader` cache (it logs the "file missing" error once, not on every request, so a fix doesn't show up in Location until the next `backend` restart).
- **Accuracy is inherently approximate.** GeoLite2-City resolves to a city-level estimate from IP allocation data, not a precise location, expect it to be wrong or blank for VPNs, corporate NAT, CGNAT, and some mobile carriers. Don't treat it as an authoritative signal on its own; it's a UX hint for "does this session look familiar," not a security control. (PBAC's `NetworkCondition`, if you use it, gates on the resolved client IP directly, see [Security Hardening: Infrastructure](../security/hardening-infra.md#reverse-proxy-ip-trust), not on this city/country lookup.)
