# Security Hardening: HTTP Layer

---

_New to a term here? See the [Infrastructure Glossary](../glossary/infrastructure.md) or [Authentication Glossary](../glossary/authentication.md)._

Response headers, CORS, cookie flags, middleware ordering, and error handling: the mechanisms that shape what the HTTP layer itself exposes to a client. See [Security Hardening](hardening.md) for the full index.

## Security response headers

`backend/mystic_auth/auth/security/security_headers_middleware.py`, applied to every response:

| Header                         | Value                                                                                                               | Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                        |

1. **HSTS is gated on `settings.ENVIRONMENT == "production"`** (checked fresh per request, not cached at import time). Sending it unconditionally would pin HSTS for a full year against real browser traffic even in a non-production deployment served over plain HTTP, with no way to turn it off short of a code change: browsers ignore the header over plain HTTP today, but that's not a reason to send a year-long pin somewhere it isn't intended to apply yet.

2. **`/docs`, `/redoc`, and `/openapi.json` get a relaxed CSP, carved out by request path.**
   - FastAPI's auto-generated Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`) pages are enabled whenever `ENVIRONMENT != "production"` (see `backend/app/main.py`), and are the one place this API actually serves HTML.
   - Both load their JS/CSS from a CDN (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`) plus an inline `<script>`/`<style>` block; ReDoc additionally pulls a Google Fonts stylesheet.
   - The blanket `default-src 'none'` policy used to apply here too, and it didn't error or warn: the page returned 200 and rendered as silently blank, every asset blocked with nothing in the response to say why.
   - `security_headers_middleware.py`'s `_DOCS_PATHS`/`_DOCS_CSP` scope a permissive-but-specific policy (`cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `fonts.googleapis.com`/`fonts.gstatic.com`, `'unsafe-inline'`) to exactly those three paths; every other route keeps the strict policy above.

3. `Strict-Transport-Security` on the frontend static build is set by nginx itself (`docker/nginx.frontend.conf`), unconditionally rather than gated on `ENVIRONMENT` like the backend's copy: the frontend production image only ever ships in a production-shaped deployment, and needs to send it itself since the local-prod-ngrok/cloudflare/tailscale tunnel modes have no other layer in front of it that would. `docker/Caddyfile` (the real prod TLS terminator) deliberately does _not_ also set it: nginx already covers every response reaching Caddy, backend and frontend alike, so Caddy adding it too would just duplicate the header. See [Docker Overview](../docker/overview.md).

4. `docker/nginx.frontend.conf` mirrors most of the backend's header set for the SPA response (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`, plus its own less-strict CSP), and also disables `server_tokens` to stop the nginx version leaking in the `Server` response header.

5. The frontend's `style-src` has no `'unsafe-inline'`: Chakra UI's `@emotion/react` runtime inserts a small, fixed number of `<style data-emotion="...">` tags once at startup and mutates their rules afterward via the CSSOM, never by rewriting `textContent` - so their hashed content stays constant across this app's own CSS, theme, brand color, and dark-mode state (verified with Playwright across public pages, an authenticated session, and a dark-mode toggle: same three `sha256-...` violations with `'unsafe-inline'` removed, zero with the hashes allow-listed instead). See the comment above `style-src` in `docker/nginx.frontend.conf` for how to regenerate the three hashes if an Emotion/Chakra upgrade changes this insertion strategy.

## CORS

`backend/app/main.py`: `CORSMiddleware` is configured as follows.

1. **Allowed origins**: `settings.cors_allowed_origins` (`FRONTEND_BASE_URL` plus any comma-separated `FRONTEND_ADDITIONAL_BASE_URLS`; single-origin by default).
2. **Credentials**: `allow_credentials=True`, required for cookie-based auth to work cross-origin in dev, where frontend `:5173` and backend `:8000` are different origins.
3. **Methods**: restricted to `GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`.
4. **Headers**: restricted to `Content-Type`.
5. Redirect/email links (OAuth callback, verification, password reset) always point at `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` alone regardless of how many origins are CORS-allowed: there's always exactly one canonical link target.

## Cookies

| Cookie          | Path    | Flags                                                                            | Set by                    |
| --------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `access_token`  | `/`     | `httponly`, `secure`, `samesite=Strict`                                          | `token_cookie_handler.py` |
| `refresh_token` | `/auth` | `httponly`, `secure`, `samesite=Strict`                                          | `token_cookie_handler.py` |
| `oauth_state`   | `/`     | `httponly`, `secure`, `samesite=Lax` (must survive Google's cross-site redirect) | `oauth2_login_handler.py` |

`secure=True` on every cookie means **local HTTP development requires the browser to treat `localhost` as a secure context** (modern browsers do this automatically for `localhost`). This will not work over plain HTTP on a non-localhost hostname.

---

## Middleware ordering

1. `main.py` adds middleware in this order: `CORSMiddleware`, `LoggingMiddleware`, `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`, then `CorrelationIdMiddleware` last.
2. Starlette applies middleware in reverse of add order, so `CorrelationIdMiddleware` ends up outermost.
3. This ensures `request.state.request_id` (and the logging contextvar it sets) is populated before any other middleware or route logic runs.

---

## Error handling

Two handlers registered in `main.py`:

1. **Global `@app.exception_handler(Exception)`**: catches every otherwise-unhandled exception, logs it with a full traceback, and returns a generic `500 {"detail": "Internal Server Error"}`.
   - Internal exception details never reach the client, regardless of `ENVIRONMENT`; `debug=` is never passed to the FastAPI app either (defaults `False`), so there's no path where Starlette's own debug error page could leak a traceback.
   - This same handler also reports the exception for error monitoring (`error_monitoring.sentry_service.capture_exception`): a no-op unless `SENTRY_DSN` is set. See [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md).

2. **More specific `@app.exception_handler(AppError)`**: catches `core/errors.py`'s `AppError`, the structured exception routes raise on purpose (`AppError(status_code, code, detail, params=None)`), and returns `{"detail", "code", "params"}` instead of the generic body above.
   - `code` is a stable, machine-readable identifier (e.g. `"INVALID_CREDENTIALS"`).
   - The frontend's `api/apiError.ts` looks it up in `errors.json` to render a translated message, falling back to the English `detail` for any route not yet migrated to `AppError`.
   - See [API Reference: error responses](../api/reference.md#error-responses) and [Translations Overview](../translations/overview/ui-and-errors.md#5-backend-error-codes-frontendsrcmystic_authapiapierrorts).
