# Security Decisions: Product

_New to a term here? See the [Infrastructure Glossary](../glossary/infrastructure.md) or [Authentication Glossary](../glossary/authentication.md)._

See [Security Decisions](decisions.md) for the full index, including auth/session and infrastructure
decisions. This page covers the _why_ behind product-level scope decisions: account lifecycle, MFA,
deferred features, and known gaps.

## Account lifecycle: soft delete by default

1. Deleting an account defaults to reversible (soft delete: `is_active=False` + `deleted_at` set, row and all FK-referencing audit/policy rows intact) rather than immediate permanent removal.
2. Permanent removal (`purge`) is a separate endpoint gated by its own, more sensitive permission (`users:purge`, granted only by `system_superuser`): an admin who can delete accounts day-to-day cannot, by that permission alone, irreversibly destroy one. See [../database/design.md](../database/design.md#account-lifecycle) for the full mechanics, including why session invalidation is done explicitly (`revoke_all_tokens_for_user`) rather than relying on the refresh endpoint to notice on its own.

**Self-service deletion** (`DELETE /users/me`, `user_self_service_routes.py::delete_my_account`) reuses this same soft-delete path, never purge:

1. The row is soft-deleted and sessions are revoked exactly like `delete_any_user`, minus the path-parameterized target and the "not your own account" guard, which doesn't apply here since acting on your own account is the entire point.
2. It writes a distinct audit event (`account_deleted_self`, vs. admin-initiated `account_deleted`) so the security audit log can tell the two apart at a glance.
3. A soft-deleted account (self- or admin-initiated) is not held forever: a daily Procrastinate periodic task (`procrastinate_tasks/account_purge_tasks.py::purge_expired_soft_deleted_accounts`, `@app.periodic(cron="0 3 * * *")`, running inside the worker process itself via Procrastinate's own `PeriodicDeferrer`, so there's no separate scheduler process for this to depend on) hard-purges any account whose `deleted_at` is older than `ACCOUNT_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS` (default 30), going through the exact same revoke → audit → delete sequence as a manual purge (`user_lifecycle/user_purge_service.py::purge_user_account`, shared by both call sites) so the grace-period purge and an admin's manual purge can never drift apart.
4. This is what gives self-service deletion an actual recovery window instead of either purging synchronously (no recovery at all) or never purging (an unbounded pile of soft-deleted rows).

Both the soft-delete step and the actual re-authentication proving intent differ by account type, though, and deliberately so:

- **An account with a password** re-authenticates and is deleted synchronously, in the same request:
  1. The caller supplies their current password (the same `password_service.verify_password` call the self-service password-change flow uses).
  2. On success, `delete_my_account` runs the soft-delete → revoke-sessions → audit sequence immediately.
  3. It then clears the `access_token`/`refresh_token` cookies on its `Response` before returning (the same cookie shape `logout_handler.py` uses, including `refresh_token`'s `path="/auth"`), a gap the endpoint had before this cookie-clearing was added, unlike every other session-ending endpoint.
- **An OAuth-only account** (`hashed_password is None`) has no password to re-confirm with, so an active session cookie alone would otherwise be sufficient proof: a stolen access-token cookie (e.g. via XSS) could delete the account outright with nothing else required. Rather than skip re-authentication for this case, `account_deletion_service.py` gives it an async, email-confirmed equivalent, modeled directly on `auth/password_logic/password_reset_service.py`:
  1. A signed JWT (`type` claim `"account_delete"`, scoping it away from access/refresh/reset tokens sharing the same `SECRET_KEY`) is minted, persisted in Redis under `account_delete:{token}` with a TTL from `ACCOUNT_DELETE_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (default 60), and emailed as a link to the frontend's `/confirm-delete` page.
  2. `delete_my_account` returns immediately in this branch without deleting anything: the account and the calling session stay untouched until the link is used.
  3. `POST /users/me/confirm-delete` (deliberately unauthenticated, same trust model as `POST /auth/password-reset/confirm`: the token itself is the proof, and the link must work from whatever device the caller opened their email on) redeems the token via Redis `GETDEL` (atomic single-use, for the same replay-race reason `password_reset_service.reset_password`'s doc-comment explains), then runs the exact same soft-delete → revoke-sessions → audit sequence as the password-account path.
  4. Both paths call one shared function (`user_lifecycle/user_self_deletion_service.py::finalize_self_deletion`) so they can't drift apart, mirroring `purge_user_account`'s share between the admin purge route and the scheduled grace-period job.
  5. The confirm endpoint also gets its own login-lockout-style rate limiting via `login_protection_service.check_and_record_action`, under a `account_delete_confirm_lock:email:` namespace distinct from both `login_lock:email:` and `password_reset_confirm_lock:email:`, for the same reason those two stay distinct from each other: a stale or reused deletion link must never count towards, or be able to trip, an unrelated lockout for that email.

## Why MFA is not enabled

No multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS, WebAuthn, or otherwise) is implemented. This is an intentionally deferred scope boundary, not an oversight discovered late.

**Why**: MFA adds real user friction (a context switch to a separate device or app to retrieve a code) that isn't justified for most applications built from this template. This was a deliberate product judgment call for a template meant to stay lean, not a technical limitation.

1. `authorization/conditions/condition_types/security_context_condition.py` and `authorization/context/request_context_builder.py` both carry explicit comments that `security_context` starts empty because this app does not implement MFA/device-trust infrastructure; any policy condition keyed on it (e.g. a hypothetical `mfa_verified` check) would currently always evaluate to false/deny.
2. The PBAC condition framework (`context_attributes`, `security_context` condition types: see [../authorization/condition-schema-reference.md](../authorization/condition-schema-reference.md)) was deliberately built generic enough that a real MFA layer could plug in later by populating `security_context` at authentication time and writing policies that key off it, without any redesign of the authorization engine itself. The `mfa_verified` key appears in tests and docs today purely as an illustrative example of the generic mechanism, not a real, enforced check.

Any real deployment that needs MFA should treat it as a deliberate follow-up: add a TOTP/WebAuthn enrollment+verification flow, populate `security_context.mfa_verified` on successful step-up auth, and gate sensitive policies on that context key. The hooks already exist to receive it.

## Intentionally deferred features

Recorded in one place rather than scattered across code comments: each of these was a deliberate scope decision for this template, not something missed:

- **MFA / device trust**: see above.
- **Email provider swapping beyond SMTP**: `emails/email_sender.py` now isolates the transport behind an `EmailSender` protocol, but only one implementation (`SMTPEmailSender`) exists; adding SES/SendGrid/Postmark support is a new class, not a framework change, and is left for whoever needs a specific provider.
- **Deploy automation**: CI verifies both Dockerfiles build but never pushes to a registry or deploys anywhere; this template assumes no specific production host (see [Deployment Guide](../deployment/production-host.md)).

See [Known Issues](../concerns/README.md) for the current backlog of accepted gaps and follow-ups (backups and others), tracked there as the single canonical list rather than duplicated here.
