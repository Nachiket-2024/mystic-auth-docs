# Security Decisions: Product

See [Security Decisions](decisions.md) for the full index, including auth/session and infrastructure
decisions. This page covers the _why_ behind product-level scope decisions: account lifecycle, MFA,
deferred features, and known gaps.

## Account lifecycle: soft delete by default

Deleting an account defaults to reversible (soft delete: `is_active=False` + `deleted_at` set, row and all FK-referencing audit/policy rows intact) rather than immediate permanent removal. Permanent removal (`purge`) is a separate endpoint gated by its own, more sensitive permission (`users:purge`, granted only by `system_superuser`): an admin who can delete accounts day-to-day cannot, by that permission alone, irreversibly destroy one. See [../database/design.md](../database/design.md#account-lifecycle) for the full mechanics, including why session invalidation is done explicitly (`revoke_all_tokens_for_user`) rather than relying on the refresh endpoint to notice on its own.

Self-service deletion (`DELETE /users/me`, `user_self_service_routes.py::delete_my_account`) reuses this same soft-delete path, never purge: the row is soft-deleted and sessions are revoked exactly like `delete_any_user` minus the path-parameterized target and the "not your own account" guard, which doesn't apply here since acting on your own account is the entire point. It writes a distinct audit event (`account_deleted_self`, vs. admin-initiated `account_deleted`) so the security audit log can tell the two apart at a glance. A soft-deleted account (self- or admin-initiated) is not held forever: a daily Procrastinate periodic task (`procrastinate_tasks/account_purge_tasks.py::purge_expired_soft_deleted_accounts`, `@app.periodic(cron="0 3 * * *")`, running inside the worker process itself via Procrastinate's own `PeriodicDeferrer`, so there's no separate scheduler process for this to depend on) hard-purges any account whose `deleted_at` is older than `ACCOUNT_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS` (default 30), going through the exact same revoke → audit → delete sequence as a manual purge (`user_lifecycle/user_purge_service.py::purge_user_account`, shared by both call sites) so the grace-period purge and an admin's manual purge can never drift apart. This is what gives self-service deletion an actual recovery window instead of either purging synchronously (no recovery at all) or never purging (an unbounded pile of soft-deleted rows).

Both the soft-delete step and the actual re-authentication proving intent differ by account type, though, and deliberately so:

- **An account with a password** re-authenticates and is deleted synchronously, in the same request: the caller supplies their current password (the same `password_service.verify_password` call the self-service password-change flow uses), and on success `delete_my_account` runs the soft-delete → revoke-sessions → audit sequence immediately, then clears the `access_token`/`refresh_token` cookies on its `Response` before returning (the same cookie shape `logout_handler.py` uses, including `refresh_token`'s `path="/auth"`): a gap the endpoint had before this cookie-clearing was added, unlike every other session-ending endpoint.
- **An OAuth-only account** (`hashed_password is None`) has no password to re-confirm with, so an active session cookie alone would otherwise be sufficient proof: a stolen access-token cookie (e.g. via XSS) could delete the account outright with nothing else required. Rather than skip re-authentication for this case, `account_deletion_service.py` gives it an async, email-confirmed equivalent, modeled directly on `auth/password_logic/password_reset_service.py`: a signed JWT (`type` claim `"account_delete"`, scoping it away from access/refresh/reset tokens sharing the same `SECRET_KEY`) is minted, persisted in Redis under `account_delete:{token}` with a TTL from `ACCOUNT_DELETE_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` (default 60), and emailed as a link to the frontend's `/confirm-delete` page. `delete_my_account` returns immediately in this branch without deleting anything: the account and the calling session stay untouched until the link is used. `POST /users/me/confirm-delete` (deliberately unauthenticated, same trust model as `POST /auth/password-reset/confirm`: the token itself is the proof, and the link must work from whatever device the caller opened their email on) redeems the token via Redis `GETDEL` (atomic single-use, for the same replay-race reason `password_reset_service.reset_password`'s doc-comment explains), then runs the exact same soft-delete → revoke-sessions → audit sequence as the password-account path. Both paths call one shared function (`user_lifecycle/user_self_deletion_service.py::finalize_self_deletion`) so they can't drift apart, mirroring `purge_user_account`'s share between the admin purge route and the scheduled grace-period job. The confirm endpoint also gets its own login-lockout-style rate limiting via `login_protection_service.check_and_record_action`, under a `account_delete_confirm_lock:email:` namespace distinct from both `login_lock:email:` and `password_reset_confirm_lock:email:`, for the same reason those two stay distinct from each other: a stale or reused deletion link must never count towards, or be able to trip, an unrelated lockout for that email.

## Why MFA is not enabled

No multi-factor authentication (TOTP, SMS, WebAuthn, or otherwise) is implemented: this is an intentionally deferred scope boundary, not an oversight discovered late. I intentionally did not implement this because MFA is something I personally hate given that its mostly just a user friction (atleast for me) that is not needed in most applications. I hate applications with MFA since it involves jumping from one app to another just to get some code to check my own login after typing password, which seems pretty useless given the fact that password IS meant for login.

- `authorization/conditions/condition_types/security_context_condition.py` and `authorization/context/request_context_builder.py` both carry explicit comments that `security_context` starts empty because this app does not implement MFA/device-trust infrastructure; any policy condition keyed on it (e.g. a hypothetical `mfa_verified` check) would currently always evaluate to false/deny.
- The PBAC condition framework (`context_attributes`, `security_context` condition types: see [../authorization/condition-schema-reference.md](../authorization/condition-schema-reference.md)) was deliberately built generic enough that a real MFA layer could plug in later by populating `security_context` at authentication time and writing policies that key off it: without any redesign of the authorization engine itself. The `mfa_verified` key appears in tests and docs today purely as an illustrative example of the generic mechanism, not a real, enforced check.

Any real deployment that needs MFA should treat it as a deliberate follow-up: add a TOTP/WebAuthn enrollment+verification flow, populate `security_context.mfa_verified` on successful step-up auth, and gate sensitive policies on that context key: the hooks already exist to receive it.

## Intentionally deferred features

Recorded in one place rather than scattered across code comments: each of these was a deliberate scope decision for this template, not something missed:

- **MFA / device trust**: see above.
- **Per-endpoint rate-limit overrides**: one global `MAX_REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW`/`REQUEST_WINDOW_SECONDS` applies to every rate-limited route; the login-specific brute-force lockout layers a second, endpoint-specific control on top of the highest-risk route instead. See [Concerns](../concerns/README.md).
- **Email provider swapping beyond SMTP**: `emails/email_sender.py` now isolates the transport behind an `EmailSender` protocol, but only one implementation (`SMTPEmailSender`) exists; adding SES/SendGrid/Postmark support is a new class, not a framework change, and is left for whoever needs a specific provider.
- **Deploy automation**: CI verifies both Dockerfiles build but never pushes to a registry or deploys anywhere; this template assumes no specific production host (see [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md#production-host-requirements)).

## Known accepted gaps / follow-ups

Recorded here rather than silently left unaddressed, so it's a deliberate backlog, not an oversight. (Forwarded-header trust, Redis authentication, and `SECRET_KEY` strength enforcement were also tracked here previously: all three are resolved and documented in [Security Hardening: Infrastructure](hardening-infra.md) now, rather than lingering here as crossed-out history.)

- **No automated database backups**: `scripts/db/db_backup.sh`/`scripts/db/db_restore.sh` now script the `pg_dump`/`psql` runbook (see [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md#backups)), but there's still no _scheduler_ wired up anywhere in this repo, since no specific production host/cloud target is assumed to hang a cron job on.
