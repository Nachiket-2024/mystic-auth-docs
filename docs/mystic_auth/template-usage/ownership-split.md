# The `app/` + `mystic_auth/` Split

---

_Part of [Using This Repository as a Template](overview.md). This is the file-ownership convention that makes [staying in sync with upstream](syncing-upstream/README.md) low-conflict: which files you can edit freely, which you should never touch, and which are shared and expect the occasional merge conflict._

Both backend and frontend are split into two trees, and every file in the repo falls into exactly one of three ownership tiers. This is purely a **file-path convention**: there's no tooling enforcing it (no `CODEOWNERS`, no merge driver), just a rule both this template and your own code agree to follow. Knowing which tier a file is in tells you whether you can edit it freely, should never edit it, or should expect the occasional merge conflict there.

You're expected to extend them (register your own router, add your own `<Route>`, add your own CI job, ignore your own generated paths, add your own Tailscale serve handler), and upstream may also touch the same file later (e.g. a middleware-ordering fix, or a dependency swap). This is the one tier where a sync merge can genuinely conflict, and it's a normal, expected part of syncing when it happens. |

`sdk.py`/`sdk.ts` re-export the pieces you're meant to build on (`require_authorization`, `Permission`, `useAuthorization`, `ProtectedRoute`, the shared `api` client, and more): import from there, not from internal `mystic_auth/` paths directly.

Your own new feature folders (`backend/app/projects/`, `frontend/src/app/projects/`) are effectively a fourth, unlisted case: upstream has no idea they exist, so they behave like the "yours" tier automatically, with no path convention needed.

The diagram above only shows code files, since it's tracing import relationships; the shared config files from the table above (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`) don't import anything, but they're in the same "Shared" tier as `main.py`/`App.tsx` for the same reason: you're expected to add your own entries, and upstream may add or change its own later. See [Syncing Upstream Template Updates](syncing-upstream/README.md) for what a conflict in one of these actually looks like.

Compose source files and env templates aren't in the Shared tier: each got the same `mystic_auth/`/`app/` split as everything else (`docker/mystic_auth/compose/` + `docker/app/compose/`, `env/mystic_auth/` + `env/app/`). Do not edit tracked `docker/mystic_auth/` files; put Compose changes in the matching `docker/app/compose/` override. Runtime copies such as `env/mystic_auth/.env.prod` are local deployment state, not upstream source, and may be edited. Every template script passes both `-f` flags and both `--env-file` flags (mystic_auth's, then app's, so an app-declared value wins on overlap) - see [Docker: Compose Modes](../docker/compose-modes.md).

The same split reaches the rest of `docker/` too:

### How to decide where a change goes

Use this decision path before creating or editing a file:

1. Is it reusable authentication, PBAC, session, audit, database, or shared UI behavior? It belongs under `backend/mystic_auth/` or `frontend/src/mystic_auth/`; use the SDK from your app code and propose template changes upstream rather than editing it in a downstream project.
2. Is it product behavior, product configuration, a custom resource, custom policy/action, branding, legal copy, or project-specific integration? Put it under `backend/app/` or `frontend/src/app/`. App-owned backend cross-cutting configuration belongs specifically in `backend/app/core/settings.py`, mirroring `backend/mystic_auth/core/settings.py`; app-owned frontend shared configuration belongs in `frontend/src/app/core/`.
3. Is it a deployment or environment change? Put it in the corresponding `docker/app/`, `env/app/`, `scripts/app/`, or `makefiles/app/` location. Merge both Compose files and both env files; the app file is loaded last, so its values win on overlap.
4. Is it a test? Put template regression tests under `tests/**/mystic_auth/` and downstream feature tests under `tests/**/app/`, mirroring the code they cover.

There is one deliberate bridge: the reusable default-policy hook reads `app.core.settings.app_settings` so a downstream project can configure `DEFAULT_APP_POLICIES` without editing MysticAuth auth flows. Treat that as an extension point, not as permission to add product fields to `backend/mystic_auth/core/settings.py`.

### One intentional content exception

The app-content translation files are the only tracked files below an
upstream-owned path that a downstream operator is expected to rewrite:

`frontend/src/mystic_auth/translations/languages/<lang>/{landing,status_pages,legal}.json`

These namespaces are registered from the app layer because their content is
deployment-specific, but the current translation layout keeps their JSON beside
the other language namespaces so language completeness can be checked as a
single set. Treat these files as **downstream-owned content with an
upstream-owned location**: edit their values when deploying, never edit the
surrounding MysticAuth translation code, and expect an upstream sync to report a
conflict if the same file changed upstream. Resolve that conflict by retaining
your reviewed deployment content and manually incorporating any new template
keys. Do not silently accept upstream copy without reviewing it.

- `docker/mystic_auth/dockerfiles/` + `docker/app/dockerfiles/`: upstream's `backend.Dockerfile`/`frontend.Dockerfile`/`backend-entrypoint.sh` versus your own, for a whole new service (not just tweaking an existing one - that's a rare enough need to treat as a "Shared, extend in place" edit on the upstream file directly). Compose lets an override file introduce a brand-new service name, not just override an existing one, so your own `docker/app/compose/docker-compose.<mode>.yml` can add a service that builds from `docker/app/dockerfiles/your-service.Dockerfile` and it merges in cleanly alongside every upstream service - see `docker/app/dockerfiles/README.md` for the exact shape.
- `docker/mystic_auth/postgres-init/` + `docker/app/postgres-init/`: Postgres bootstrap scripts. Postgres only scans files directly inside `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`, not subdirectories, so a fork's own init script needs an explicit per-file mount in its own `docker/app/compose/docker-compose.<mode>.yml` rather than just dropping a file in - see `docker/app/postgres-init/README.md` for the exact mount syntax.
- `docker/mystic_auth/Caddyfile` + `docker/app/caddy/`: the prod reverse-proxy config. Caddy's `import` directive with a glob matching zero files is a no-op, not an error, so upstream's Caddyfile ends with `import /etc/caddy/app/*.caddy` and `docker-compose.prod.yml` mounts `docker/app/caddy/` there unconditionally - a fork's own `.caddy` site block is picked up with no compose edit needed. Verified live: `caddy validate` passes against the real (empty) `docker/app/caddy/` as shipped.
- `docker/mystic_auth/nginx.frontend.conf` + `docker/app/nginx/`: same pattern for the frontend's production nginx config, using nginx's own `include` with a glob (also a no-op on zero matches). Since this file is baked into the image at build time rather than mounted, `docker/mystic_auth/dockerfiles/frontend.Dockerfile` copies `docker/app/nginx/` into the image unconditionally instead - verified live with a real `docker build --target production` and `nginx -t` against the built image.

`docker/tailscale-serve-config.json` is the one exception, and stays Shared tier: it's a single JSON document with no native include/merge mechanism (unlike Caddy/nginx), and building a custom merge step (e.g. a `jq`-based entrypoint wrapper) would add real fragility for a file that's normally under 20 lines and simplest to just hand-edit. The same reasoning applies to `backend/requirements.txt`/`alembic.ini`/`pyproject.toml` sitting at `backend/` and not under either split folder: each tool expects its config at one specific path, so it can't be split without either breaking the tool or building more machinery than the customization is worth.

The root `Makefile` and `make.ps1` get the split too, the same way. Both `make` and PowerShell can pull in another file at runtime (`include`/`-include` for Make, dot-sourcing for PowerShell), so unlike `main.py`/`App.tsx` there's no reason to force them into the Shared tier: the real targets live in `makefiles/mystic_auth/Makefile` + `makefiles/app/Makefile` (and the `make.ps1` equivalents, a `$MysticAuthTargets` hashtable merged with `$AppTargets`), and the root files themselves are two lines of `include` each - stable enough that a sync almost never touches them, and add-only for you: a target with the same name in `makefiles/app/` overrides the upstream one, verified live (`make hello`/`.\make.ps1 hello` after adding one).
