# Command Cheat Sheet

---

_Part of [Using This Repository as a Template](overview.md). One-line "when to run this" for every script in the template, so you don't have to re-read each one's own doc page to remember what it's for. Each command shown is the `.sh` (Git Bash/WSL/Linux/macOS) form; swap `.sh` for `.ps1` (PowerShell) or `.cmd` (Command Prompt) - same arguments, same behavior. A `make` (or, on native Windows, `make.ps1`) target exists for the most common ones too - see [Makefile shortcuts](#makefile-shortcuts) below._

## Day one

| Command                                                    | When to run it                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/quickstart/quickstart.sh` | Fresh clone, want a working login in one command. See [Quickstart](quickstart.md).                                                                                                                 |
| `./scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/setup-env/setup-env.sh`   | Just the env-file bootstrap step, without bringing the stack up. Prompts for app name, brand color, and optionally Google OAuth/Gmail credentials. Safe to re-run, skips files that already exist. |
| `./scripts/mystic_auth/docker/dev/dev-up.sh`               | Bring the dev stack up (or back up after a reboot). Waits for every service to become healthy, then tails `backend`/`frontend`/`procrastinate_worker` logs.                                        |

## Day two and after

Fails if a secret is still the shipped placeholder under `ENVIRONMENT=production`; warns on remaining `<your_...>` placeholders, a host port already in use, or a blank/invalid `BUGSINK_SUPERUSER_EMAIL` (which crash-loops Bugsink and takes backend/frontend down with it). |

## Staying in sync with upstream

| Command                                                      | When to run it                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/sync-upstream.sh`       | Pull in fixes/features from the original template. See [Staying in Sync with Upstream](syncing-upstream/README.md) for the full walkthrough.                                                                         |
| `./scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/check-alembic-heads.sh` | After a sync, check whether it and your own project each added a migration on the same fork point (two heads). Run automatically as part of `sync-upstream.sh`; standalone here for re-checking without a full sync. |

## Verifying your own changes to this template's tooling

_Only relevant if you're modifying `scripts/mystic_auth/` itself - upstream maintenance, not day-to-day template use._

| Command                                                         | When to run it                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tests/scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/test-env-tooling.sh`       | After touching any `env-tools/` script. Regression suite against a throwaway copy of `env/`, never touches your real files. Runs in CI too.                                                                        |
| `tests/scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/test-sync-upstream.sh` | After touching `sync-upstream.sh`. Regression suite against throwaway fake repos. Runs in CI too.                                                                                                                  |
| `tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-script-paths.sh`          | After any rename/restructure. Checks every script/doc's own `scripts/`/`local-scripts/` path references actually resolve. Runs in CI too.                                                                          |
| `tests/scripts/mystic_auth/lint/check-split-paths.sh`           | After any rename/restructure. Checks for a stale pre-split `docker/`/`env/`/`scripts/` path reference (one that's missing its `mystic_auth/`/`app/` segment) anywhere in source, scripts, or docs. Runs in CI too. |

## Makefile shortcuts

If you have `make` installed (already the case on most Linux/macOS setups, and inside WSL/Git Bash), the root `Makefile` wraps the most common commands above so you don't need to remember the full path or which platform script to use:

```bash
make dev              # ./scripts/mystic_auth/docker/dev/dev-up.sh
make quickstart       # ./scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/quickstart/quickstart.sh
make setup-env        # ./scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/setup-env/setup-env.sh
make check-env        # ./scripts/mystic_auth/env-tools/check-env/check-env.sh
make superuser        # create/promote the system superuser
make sync             # ./scripts/mystic_auth/upstream-sync/sync-upstream.sh
make help             # list every target
```

This is purely a convenience layer: everything it runs is one of the commands above, unchanged.

**On native Windows (PowerShell, no WSL/Git Bash) without `make`**, `make` itself doesn't ship with Windows at all, unlike on Linux/macOS where it's either preinstalled or one package-manager command away. Rather than asking you to install a new tool just for this, use the root `make.ps1` instead: the same targets, ships with every Windows install already (no extra install), just swap `make` for `.\make.ps1`:

```powershell
.\make.ps1 dev
.\make.ps1 quickstart
.\make.ps1 help
```

A few targets (`test-tooling`, `test-sync`, `lint-paths`, `lint-split`, `backup`) are regression suites and a db-dump script that only exist as `.sh` files, since they're dev-only tooling, not something a template consumer runs day to day; `make.ps1` shells out to `bash` for those (Git for Windows already provides it if you cloned this repo with Git in the first place). Every other target runs natively in PowerShell, no `bash` needed.

Neither `make` nor PowerShell required at all? Use the `.sh`/`.ps1`/`.cmd` commands directly instead - nothing here requires either wrapper.

Want your own target (a `deploy-staging`, a `lint`)? Add it to `makefiles/app/Makefile` (and/or `makefiles/app/make.ps1`'s `$AppTargets` hashtable) instead of editing the root `Makefile`/`make.ps1` - those files ship empty and upstream never touches them again, so your target survives every future `sync-upstream.sh` run untouched. See [The `app/` + `mystic_auth/` Split](ownership-split.md).
