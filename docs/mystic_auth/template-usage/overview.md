# Using This Repository as a Template

---

## What this template provides

This template ships the authenticated app shell (sidebar, top bar, and the auth/PBAC/audit-log pages listed below) plus a minimal pre-auth landing page at `/` (`frontend/src/app/landing_page/LandingPage.tsx`, mounted in `frontend/src/app/App.tsx`) that redirects an already-signed-in visitor straight to `/dashboard`. It's a worked example of the "outside the auth shell" page shape, not a page meant to ship as-is - rename, restyle, or replace it freely (see [worked example §6](worked-example.md#6-a-pre-auth-landing-page)).

- **Authentication**: email+password with Argon2 hashing, email verification, rate limiting + brute-force lockout, Google OAuth2 (PKCE), JWT access+refresh tokens as httpOnly cookies, refresh-token rotation with reuse detection, logout/logout-all, forgot/reset password. See [Authentication Overview](../authentication/overview.md).
- **Authorization**: Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC), not RBAC. Every protected route is gated by an assigned `Policy`, not by a user's `role`. Policies are data (rows in Postgres), so a new access rule is a new policy, not a new deploy. See [PBAC Architecture](../authorization/architecture/README.md).
- **Audit logging**: two append-only tables: security/session events, and every PBAC allow/deny decision. See [Database Design](../database/design.md#why-two-audit-tables-not-one).
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript, Vite, Chakra UI v3, Zustand, TanStack Query. See [Frontend Architecture](../architecture/frontend.md).
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose (dev + prod), PostgreSQL, Redis, Procrastinate async email (Postgres-native, no separate broker), Alembic migrations, GitHub Actions CI.
- **Error monitoring**: self-hosted Bugsink, on by default with the stack. See [Error Monitoring](../error-monitoring/overview.md).

## Get started

New clone, first time here? Start with **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)**: the one-command path from `git clone` to a working login, each step run by hand instead, keeping env files honest over time, and setting up Google OAuth and email.

Already set up and just need a reminder of which script does what? See the **[Command Cheat Sheet](cheatsheet.md)**.

## The `app/` + `mystic_auth/` split

Every file in the repo falls into exactly one of three ownership tiers, so a future `sync-upstream.sh` run stays low-conflict. See **[The `app/` + `mystic_auth/` Split](ownership-split.md)** for the full tiering table and diagram.

---

## Building on this template

New domain/resource, database changes, PBAC route protection, replacing the frontend entirely: see **[Building On This Template](customization.md)**.

---

## Deployment

See the [Deployment Guide](../deployment/guide.md) for Compose topology, required env vars, migrations, backups, and production host requirements. Use one of the [`docker-compose.local-prod-*.yml`](../deployment/local-prod/README.md#which-tunnel-do-i-want) variants for a production-style local or self-hosted run behind a free tunnel. Use [`docker-compose.prod.yml`](https://github.com/Nachiket-2024/mystic-auth/blob/main/docker/mystic_auth/compose/docker-compose.prod.yml) for self-hosting on your own server, where Caddy terminates TLS.

## Staying in sync with upstream template updates

Pulling in fixes/features from the original template once your own project has diverged from it now lives in its own doc, including the full step-by-step walkthrough and a worked conflict-resolution example: see [Staying in Sync with Upstream Template Updates](syncing-upstream/README.md).

## Where to go next

- New to the codebase? Start at [`docs/mystic_auth/README.md`](../README.md) for the full index.
- Building a protected feature? [Adding New Permissions](../authorization/adding-permissions.md), protect the route as shown in [Building On This Template](customization.md#pbac-usage), then [Writing and Testing Policies](../authorization/writing-testing-policies.md).
- Something not behaving as documented? [PBAC Troubleshooting](../authorization/troubleshooting/README.md).
