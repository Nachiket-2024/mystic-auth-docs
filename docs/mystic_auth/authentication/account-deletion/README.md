# Account Deletion and Purge

---

This doc covers the full account-deletion lifecycle across backend, frontend, and the scheduled
cleanup job: self-service delete (both the password-account and OAuth-only-account paths), admin
delete/reactivate/purge, and the automatic grace-period purge. It is split out of
[Database Design: Account lifecycle](../../database/design.md#account-lifecycle) and
[Security Decisions: Product](../../security/decisions-product.md) so the full flow, end to end, lives in one place
with the sequence of each path made explicit.

## Pages

- [Self-Service Paths](self-service.md): why there are two paths, and how each one works.
- [Admin Actions and Purge](admin-and-purge.md): admin delete/reactivate/purge, and the scheduled grace-period purge.
- [Frontend](frontend.md): `DeleteAccountCard` and the `/confirm-delete` page.

## Configuration

| Setting                               | Meaning                                                                          | Default |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `ACCOUNT_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS`            | Days a soft-deleted account stays recoverable before the scheduled job purges it | 30      |
| `ACCOUNT_DELETE_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` | Lifetime of the OAuth-only-account confirmation link                             | 60      |

Both live in `backend/mystic_auth/core/settings.py` and are set via `.env`.

## Production checks

- Backend integration tests cover both self-service paths (password re-confirm success/failure,
  OAuth-only send-and-confirm, expired/reused token, rate limiting on the confirm endpoint), admin
  soft-delete/reactivate/purge, self-targeting and system-account guards, and that the scheduled job
  only purges accounts past their grace period.
- Backend unit tests cover `account_deletion_service` token issue/verify and
  `user_purge_service.purge_user_account` in isolation.
- Frontend integration tests cover `DeleteAccountCard` for both account types (password re-confirm
  validation, the "check your email" state) and `ConfirmDeleteAccountPage`'s success/error/expired
  states.
